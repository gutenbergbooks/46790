<h2><a name="FOREWORD_TO_NEW_IMPRESSION" id="FOREWORD_TO_NEW_IMPRESSION">FOREWORD TO NEW IMPRESSION</a></h2>


<p>It has given me great pleasure that a new impression
of my <i>History of Bohemian Literature</i> should have
been required. I am, I think, justified in believing
that the British public now takes a certain though
still limited interest in the literature and language of
my country. I am also perhaps not wrong in thinking
that the origin of the struggles in the Austro-Hungarian
empire&mdash;almost entirely attributable as it
is to racial and linguistic discord&mdash;has become better
understood in England. As I show in my book, the
revival of Bohemian literature was largely responsible
for the movement in favour of Bohemian autonomy;
and the early leaders of the Bohemian movement in
the nineteenth century were mostly literary men. I
am justified, therefore, in claiming a certain political
importance for this book. The new impression on
the whole differs little from the former one, and in
revising the book I noticed with pleasure how few
printer's errors required correction&mdash;a somewhat astonishing
fact if we consider how difficult the spelling
of Slavic words is. I have added considerably to the
last pages of the book, which deal mainly with writers
who are now alive. This part of the subject had
been previously somewhat neglected, as I originally
intended to omit all mention of living authors.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>With the approval of Mr. Gosse, I have written this
short History of Bohemian Literature according to a
plan that differs considerably from that of certain earlier
volumes in this Series. The works of Modern English,
French, Italian, and even of Ancient Greek and Spanish
writers, will be known to many readers of the volumes
that deal with them. Bohemian literature, on the other
hand, is absolutely unknown in Western Europe, and a
large amount of space has therefore been devoted to
translated quotations from Bohemian writers. Many of
these unknown works have great interest and value.</p>

<p>Bohemian literature, as we possess it, is to a certain
extent disappointing and unsatisfactory. In consequence
of the wholesale destruction of everything written in
Bohemian that continued during more than a century,
countless Bohemian books, many of which are known
to have been valuable, have disappeared.</p>

<p>Many forms of literature are scarcely represented in
Bohemian. No dramatic works worthy of notice exist
before the present century. Poetry also is valuable only
in the earliest period and in the present century.</p>

<p>Bohemian literature is so closely connected with
Bohemian history, that without some knowledge of the
latter it is often difficult to understand the references to
historical events which must necessarily be found in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
history of Bohemian literature. Though I have sometimes
explained such references by notes, I could not
do this to any great extent without trespassing on the
domain of history. Those who wish to turn their attention
to the dramatic history of Bohemia will find their
best guide up to the year 1526 in Palack&yacute;, whose monumental
<i>History of Bohemia</i> was published in German as
well as in Bohemian. Though no continuous narrative
on the same plan brings Bohemian history down to the
year 1620, Gindely, Tieftrunk, and Rezek have written
extensively, in German as well as in Bohemian, on the
last years of Bohemian independence. Professor Tomek
has in his short <i>Geschichte B&ouml;hmens</i> given an outline of
the history of the country from the earliest ages up to the
present day. I have in my <i>Bohemia: an Historical Sketch</i>,
endeavoured to give a brief account of the history of
Bohemia from an early period to the year 1620, written
in accordance with the requirements of non-Bohemian
readers.</p>

<p>Bohemian writers have divided the literature of their
country into three periods. The first extends from the
earliest time to the days of Hus; the second from Hus
to the battle of the White Mountain; the third from that
battle to the present day. Chaps. I. and II. of this book
deal with the first; Chaps. III., IV., V., and VI. with
the second; and Chap. VII. with the third period.</p>

<p>Like the history, the literature also of Bohemia is,
particularly in the most interesting periods, a record
of incessant religious struggles. I am thoroughly conscious
of the fact that an account of these struggles is
a most difficult task, that the writer</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Incedit per ignes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suppositos cineri doloso."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>
<p>I can only express my conscientious belief that I have
delineated these religious controversies in accordance
with the writings of the most accredited authorities.</p>

<p>I have only been able to allude incidentally to some of
the materials that I have used while writing this book. I
have, however, principally relied on a prolonged study of
the works of the Bohemian writers with whom my work
deals. It is at least the privilege of a critic of so little
known a literature as that of Bohemia that he is not
confronted by an enormous amount of anciently accumulated
criticism. In one or two cases where I felt
uncertain, I have had the privilege of receiving advice
from Professor Josef Kalousek, of the Bohemian University
of Prague, and from Mr. Adolphus Patera, head-librarian
of the Bohemian Museum in that town. I have
entirely limited my remarks to the works of those Bohemian
writers who have general interest, or are at least
characteristic of their time. Very many names contained
in the histories of Bohemian literature written in the
national language have therefore been omitted.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>The Slavic language, a branch of the great Aryan family
of speech, was originally one. It gradually divided itself
into various dialects, a certain number of which have
become written languages. According to the generally
accepted division, the existent Slavic languages are divided
into three great classes&mdash;the North-Eastern, Southern,
and Western groups. The last-named group consists of
the Bohemian and Polish languages and the almost extinct
dialect of the Lusatians in Prussia and Saxony.</p>

<p>The Bohemian language is spoken in a large and continuous
part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, comprising
the greater part of Bohemia and Moravia, part of
Silesia, a small portion of the Archduchy of Austria, and
extensive districts in Northern Hungary. There are considerable
numbers of Bohemians beyond the borders of
this continuous territory, in Lower Austria (particularly
in Vienna), in Prussian Silesia (where their homes adjoin
those of the Bohemians in Austrian Silesia), in Russia
(particularly in Volhynia), and in the United States of
America.</p>

<p>According to the most authentic statistics, the Bohemian
language is spoken by about 7,930,000 people. Of these,
7,650,000 live in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, 70,000
in Prussia, 60,000 in Russia, and 150,000 in the United
States of America. Minor Bohemian colonies, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
that in London, do not require special notice: the native
language also often disappears here after one or two
generations.</p>

<p>The Slavonic inhabitants of Northern Hungary, identical
with the Bohemians as regards their race, have in the
present century developed a written language somewhat
different from that of Bohemia. If we therefore deduct
them from the total, we come to the result that the Bohemian
language is spoken by about 5,750,000 people.</p>

<p class="ph1">BOHEMIAN LITERATURE</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />

THE EARLIEST BOHEMIAN POETRY</h2>


<p>If it were possible to compare the greatest literature of
the world with that of a small and little-known country,
it might be said that the "Question of the Manuscripts"
is the necessary beginning of every account of Bohemian
literature, just as the "Homeric Question" must
form the commencement of every work on the literature
of Greece. The "Question of the Manuscripts" turns
on the genuineness of two documents which first became
known at the beginning of the present century, and were
supposed to be the most ancient writings in the Bohemian
language. These manuscripts have from the first
attracted great notice, and they gave a great impulse to
the revival of Bohemian literature in the present century.
The Manuscript of K&ouml;niginhof is also by no means
devoid of poetical merit, and these documents will therefore
always have to be mentioned, even should it be
finally proved that both were forgeries.</p>

<p>The manuscript that was first discovered is the so-called
<i>Rukopis Kralodvorsky</i> or Manuscript of K&ouml;nig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>inhof.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was stated that this document had been found
by Venceslas Hanka (afterwards librarian of the Bohemian
Museum) in the tower of the deanery church of
K&ouml;niginhof, or Kr&aacute;lov&eacute; Dvur, on September 16, 1817.
It was further declared that Hanka's attention had first
been attracted to the manuscript by Bor&#269;, chaplain at
K&ouml;niginhof, who was previously aware of its existence.
The discovery at K&ouml;niginhof immediately created great
sensation even in countries very distant from Bohemia,
a circumstance all the more worthy of note as Bohemia
was then even more unknown than it now is. Goethe
was greatly interested in the new discovery, to which he
frequently refers in his writings, and he himself published
a translation, or rather adaptation, of the <i>Kytice</i>
(Nosegay), one of the lyrical poems of the Manuscript
of K&ouml;niginhof. Numerous translations of these
poems into English,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> German, Polish, Russian, Italian,
and other languages soon appeared, and the interest was
of course yet far greater in Bohemia itself, where they became
the recognised models for the Bohemian writers who
were then beginning to revive the national language.</p>

<p>Though some doubts as to the genuineness of the
manuscript were expressed from the moment of its appearance,
yet the majority of the Bohemian learned men,
including such authorities as Palack&yacute; and &#352;afa&#345;ik, firmly
maintained its ancient origin. Within the last twenty
years a change has taken place. Perhaps the majority
of the Bohemian philologists of the present day believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>the manuscript to be a forgery, that is to say, that it was
written at the beginning of the present century. Its
genuineness has been attacked from the pal&aelig;ographic
point of view; it has been attempted to prove anachronisms
in the manuscript; and it has been asserted that
it contains verbal formations unknown to the early Bohemian
language. A chemical examination of the manuscript
has, however, proved that it differs in no way from
authentic Bohemian manuscripts of the fourteenth century,
and it can therefore now be affirmed that the Manuscript
of K&ouml;niginhof cannot be attacked from the point of
view of pal&aelig;ography.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The defenders of the manuscript
have been less successful in their endeavours to disprove
the statement that it contains anachronisms, which
could not have been committed by a writer of the thirteenth
or fourteenth century. The almost complete
darkness which surrounds the condition of the Slavonic
race in very early times renders it very difficult to form
a judgment on many of the disputed points. The defenders
of the manuscript also lay stress on its similarity
to undoubtedly genuine collections of early Bohemian
writings, such as those known as the Manuscript of
K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz and that of St. Vitus. It is true that the contents
of these collections differ somewhat from those of
the manuscript, and are mainly of a religious character.</p>

<p>As regards the philological test, it is certain that the
manuscript contains some verbal formations of which no
other example can be found in the scanty remains of
early Bohemian writings that have been preserved. On
the other hand, in consequence of the very scantiness
of these remains, a  &#7945;&#960;&#945;&#958; &#923;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957; does not necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>prove the falsehood of the document in which we find it.
The defenders of the manuscript have shown great ingenuity
in proving that many of the locutions, unknown
to ancient Bohemian, may be traced to the Moravian
dialect, which at all times has differed somewhat from
the language of Bohemia. They therefore maintain that
the poems of the manuscript originated not in Bohemia
itself, but in the sister-land, Moravia.</p>

<p>If the falsehood of the manuscript be admitted, the
question arises, Who was the falsifier? who at the beginning
of the present century, when the Bohemian
language was at its lowest level, had a sufficient knowledge
of that language to have written these poems?
Hanka, of whom it is natural to think, has left us verses
of his own so vastly inferior to some of the poems contained
in the manuscript, that it is almost impossible to
believe him to have been its author.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may be the final result of the discussion,
the Manuscript of K&ouml;niginhof will always remain one of
the curiosities of literature. The first part of the manuscript
consists of six ballads, if we may thus describe
them, five of which deal with warlike events; the first,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
which describes a battle between the Bohemians and the
Germans, has a distinctly heathen character. The sixth
ballad contains a description of a tournament, and is one
of those pieces in which the opponents of the genuineness
of the manuscript think that they have discovered
anachronisms. The second part of the manuscript consists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>of eight shorter songs. Some of them are by no
means devoid of poetic merit, but they have a somewhat
sentimental manner, which makes them appear rather
modern to the reader. The adversaries of the manuscript
have not been slow in noting this circumstance.
I shall only translate one of the short poems of the

<p>In view of the uncertainty concerning the authenticity
of the Manuscript of K&ouml;niginhof, it is obviously impossible
to assign a date to it. The writers who believe in
its genuine character hold that the poems were transcribed
and collected in their present shape at the end
of the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth
century, but that some of them are of far higher antiquity.
The distinctly heathen character of one of these
poems renders this certain, of course, if only we can
dismiss the supposition of a modern falsification.</p>

<p>The second ancient Bohemian manuscript that was
supposed to have been discovered at the beginning of
the present century is that of Zelen&aacute; Hora or Gr&uuml;neberg,
which is generally mentioned in connection with the
Manuscript of K&ouml;niginhof, and is printed together with it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
in most editions. It has now been proved that the Manuscript
of Gr&uuml;neberg is a falsification dating from the
present century, and its genuineness is now no longer
maintained by any scholars, though a natural patriotic
feeling has rendered it painful to many to admit that
this manuscript, which was attributed to the ninth century,
and described as "the most ancient document in
Bohemian, and indeed in all Slavonic literature," is
nothing but a fraudulent imposture.</p>

<p>It is proverbially easy to be wise <i>post eventum</i>, that
is, in this case, after the fact of a forgery is recognised,
but it is difficult to repress very natural surprise that the
mysterious manner in which the Manuscript of Gr&uuml;neberg
first became known did not create greater suspicion
than was actually the case. The manuscript was
(in 1818) sent anonymously by post to Francis Count
Kolovrat-Liebsteinsky, then high burgrave (or governor)
of Bohemia. That nobleman had shortly before published
an appeal to the Bohemians in favour of the
National or Bohemian Museum, of which he was one of
the founders, and which had as principal object the
preservation of the relics of Bohemian antiquity. It was
not until many years later that John Kov&aacute;r, steward on
Count Colloredo's estate of Gr&uuml;neberg, declared that he
had found the manuscript in an outlying room of the
castle of Gr&uuml;neberg; he further stated that he had
believed his master, Count Colloredo, to have been so
thoroughly German in his feelings that he would have
destroyed the manuscript had it been shown to him.
It is difficult for others than Bohemians to realise the
absurdity of such a statement. The strictly absolutist
government of Austria during the first half of the present
century inexorably suppressed all public demonstrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of national feeling; whether German or Slavonic. It was
thus impossible that literary controversies should assume
a political aspect at that period, though this has certainly
happened in more recent times. It was equally absurd
to suggest that Count Colloredo, a distinguished general
during the Napoleonic wars, was likely to take any
interest whatever in documents belonging to the early
period of the Bohemian language&mdash;a language that then,
and even far more recently, was almost unknown to the
upper classes of Bohemian society.</p>

<p>The Manuscript of Gr&uuml;neberg consists of two small
fragments of parchment, one of which contains a few
lines only, entitled "The Decree of Domestic Law."
The second larger fragment is called the "Judgment of
Libussa." It deals with the semi-mythical Bohemian
princess who is the heroine of many ancient tales. It is
curious to note that many very grave disquisitions on
the early social condition and judicial institutions of
the Slavonic race have been based on this apocryphal
manuscript.</p>

<p>The "Question of the Manuscripts," at least with
regard to that of K&ouml;niginhof, is yet undecided. The
vast literature on the subject which has gradually
accumulated has incidentally thrown much light on
many social and philological questions concerning
ancient Bohemia and its language. The committee of
the Bohemian Museum no doubt indirectly expressed
its opinion when the Manuscript of Gr&uuml;neberg was
removed from public view, while that of K&ouml;niginhof
continued to be exhibited in the hall of manuscripts
in the museum.</p>

<p>Several other Bohemian manuscripts purporting to
be of very ancient origin also made their appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
at the beginning of the present century, and modern
additions were made to an authentic ancient manuscript.
These falsifications were soon discovered, and
in some cases suspicion undoubtedly points to Hanka.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The earliest Bohemian writings, the authenticity of
which is uncontested, have a distinctly Christian and
religious character. One of the most ancient written
documents in the Bohemian language is the hymn
"Gospodi pomiluj ny" (Lord have mercy on us). The
earliest version is written in a language resembling the
Old Slavonic, but with many specially Bohemian locutions.
The authorship of the hymn has been attributed
to St. Cyrillus and to St. Methodius, or to their early
disciples, but there is no evidence to prove this conjecture.
The date of the hymn also cannot be fixed, but
the chronicler, Comas of Prague, tells us that it was
sung by the people at the installation of Bishop Dietmar
of Prague in 973. The hymn is sung, in a modernised
version, in the Bohemian churches up to the present day.</p>

<p>Another very ancient hymn that has great historical
interest is that to St. Venceslas. The date of this hymn
also cannot be ascertained, but there is evidence that
the veneration for the murdered Prince Venceslas was
already very great in the eleventh century, and the hymn
is certainly very ancient. The existent version dates
from the thirteenth century. The composition of the
hymn, which is rhymeless, but has frequent assonances,
also vouches for its antiquity. The three original strophes
run thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Holy Venceslas&mdash;Duke of the Bohemian land&mdash;Our
Prince&mdash;Pray for us to God&mdash;And the Holy Ghost&mdash;Kyrie
Eleison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beautiful is the court of heaven&mdash;Happy he who
enters there&mdash;Into eternal life&mdash;And the clear light&mdash;Of
the Holy Ghost&mdash;Kyrie Eleison.</p>

<p>"Thy help we implore&mdash;Have mercy on us&mdash;Comfort
the mournful&mdash;Deliver us from all evil&mdash;Holy Venceslas&mdash;Kyrie
Eleison."</p>

<p>Many further strophes were added to this hymn
when it became famous. During the Hussite wars it
was the favourite war-song of the "lords sub una"
(= Catholics), while the utraquists or Hussites sang the
famous "All ye warriors of God."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Among the very ancient documents written in the
Bohemian language are a considerable number of
missals, psalm-books, and translations of portions of the
Holy Scriptures, which, though of great archaeological
and historical interest, hardly require notice in an
account of Bohemian literature.</p>

<p>Undeniable literary value, on the other hand, belongs
to some of the many early Bohemian legends that have
been preserved. Some have been known since the
beginning of the revival of Bohemian literature, while
others have been discovered quite recently, sometimes
in parish churches or the libraries of remote monasteries.
Such discoveries indeed continue up to the present day.
A considerable number of these legends (with a few
small writings of a more secular character) are contained
in two collections, known respectively as the manuscripts
of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz and of St. Vitus, the cathedral
church of Prague.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Many of these legends are very similar in character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>and obviously adhere closely to Latin models. This,
however, does not apply to all. <i>The Legend of Judas</i>
differs greatly from other medi&aelig;val legends that deal with
the same subject. It has a distinctly Oriental manner,
and a strange similarity to the Greek tale of <i>&#338;dipus</i>.
This is one of the few early legends the date of which
can be approximately fixed. The author alludes to the
murder of the last Premyslide prince (1306) as to a
recent event. After referring to the death of "the hope
of the Scariotic land" the author writes: "Let us on
this occasion remember our country, that which has
now happened in Bohemia, where there are now no
kings descended from King Premysl."</p>

<p>One of the saints whose martyrdom the Bohemian
writers have specially celebrated is St. Catherine. A
long legend on this subject, which formed part of the
Rosenberg Library,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was discovered at Stockholm, and
has since been transported to Br&uuml;nn. A more concise
account of St. Catherine's martyrdom is preserved in the
Church of St. Jacob at Br&uuml;nn. Both legends have been
published.</p>

<p>According to the longer legend, Catherine, daughter of
Kost, King of Cyprus, declared that she would wed no
one but Jesus Christ. She therefore refuses to marry
the son of the heathen Emperor Maxentius. After fifty
of the wisest masters vainly attempted to persuade her
to renounce Christianity, Catherine is cruelly tortured
by order of the Emperor Maxentius, and finally decapitated.
The description of her martyrdom gives a curious
insight into medi&aelig;val mysticism. By order of the Emperor,
who is enraged at her steadfastness, "the beadles
whip her with threefold whips of horse-hair," which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>have "leaden knots and angles;" then her snow-white
nude body appears in six colours: her body appears
white, her face green; red the flowing stream of blood;
black the open wounds; blue the stripes caused by the
whip; golden the plaits of her hair. All these colours
of course have a mystical significance. When Catherine
is decapitated, milk, as symbol of her purity, flows from
her body.</p>

<p>Less known than the legend of St. Catherine, but
certainly equally valuable, is the Bohemian legend of
St. Dorothy. The martyrdom of that saint has been
a favourite subject for the painters and poets of many
countries. In our time Mr. Swinburne has made it the
subject of a beautiful poem. Several Bohemian versions
of the legend have been preserved. The most interesting
of them, though probably not one of the oldest, is the
version contained in the manuscript of St. Vitus. It is
written in short and somewhat irregular rhymes. The
medi&aelig;val mystical idea of the marriage between Christ
and female saints appears here even more prominently
than in the legend of St. Catherine. Dorothy, who is of
royal blood, refuses to marry the cruel heathen King
Fabricius and to renounce the Christian faith. The
poem begins with a short invocation of St. Dorothy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Dorothy, O maiden fair,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The Holy Church celebrates thy festival,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For thou wast a maiden choice,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>One chosen by God.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Thy virtues, beauty, and purity</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No one can describe;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Adorned by these</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Thou wast wedded to Christ.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rejoicing now with thy husband,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Help us in our misery;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lead us to eternal bliss.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>In consequence of her refusal to renounce Christianity,
Dorothy is cruelly scourged by order of King Fabricius.
The description of her sufferings is very similar to that
contained in the legend of St. Catherine, but we miss the
curious conceit of the six colours that suddenly appear
on the body of the martyr. Dorothy is finally led out
to execution, and on her way meets "Theophilus, the
clerk of the land," who mockingly asks her where she is
going. Dorothy answers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>To a garden, a delightful one,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In which manifold fruits,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Apples, flowers, and roses,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I shall gather.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Theophilus replies with a sneer, "Send me some of
the fruits which grow in your lord's garden." After
Dorothy's death "a child beautifully dressed in purple"
(that is, an angel) appears to Theophilus, carrying a
basket which contains three apples and three roses. The
child says, "My sister Dorothy sends you this fruit."
Then, seeing this, Theophilus exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I believe in thee, O Jesus Christ,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That thou art the living Son</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of the True God,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For whose sake the virtuous Dorothy,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Guiltless, was executed to-day.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I the sinner beg, O maiden,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Earnestly for thy favour;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Deign to intercede for me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That in the realm of thy husband</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I too may join thee.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The legend of St. Prokop (which forms part of the
Manuscript of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz) also deserves special notice.
It incidentally throws considerable light on the condition
of Bohemia at the period when Christianity was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
introduced. There was then great antagonism between
the partisans of the Greek ritual, which Cyrillus and
Methodius had introduced, and the followers of the
Latin Church, who from Germany had introduced their
ritual into Bohemia. The monastery on the Sazava<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, of
which Prokop became abbot, was the centre of those
who sympathised with the Eastern Church. Up to the
time when the Slavonic monks were replaced by priests
of the Latin Church (in 1096), the religious services were
held there according to the Eastern ritual, and when
Charles IV. again established a community of Slavonic
monks at Prague, he obtained for it the Pope's permission
to use the Slavonic tongue in all ecclesiastical
functions and to employ the Glagolitic alphabet<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.
The legend, written in an awkward and unattractive
style, has little artistic value. The author was, no
doubt, a monk, since the monastery of Sazava and its
records were probably his source of information. As
is the case with most early Bohemian legends, it is
very difficult to fix the date of that referring to St.
Prokop. The existent manuscript probably belongs to
the early part of the fourteenth century, though the circumstance
that some rhymes have been corrupted and
lines omitted has led Bohemian critics to the supposition
that the legend was written a considerable time before,
perhaps not long after the death of St. Prokop, who
lived in the eleventh century. The legend<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, as already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>stated, deals principally with the rivalry between the
monks of the Eastern and those of the Roman ritual.
Prokop, who had retired to the then desert region near
the river Sazava, is found there by Prince Ulrick, who
builds a monastery for him on the spot where they met.
After Prokop's death, as well as that of Prince Ulrick,
"Germans of the Latin rite" take possession of the
monastery on the Sazava. The ghost of Prokop three
times appears to them, and on his third apparition the
Germans return terrified to Prague.</p>

<p>The author begins by thus addressing his readers:
"Listen, old people and children&mdash;To what I wish to tell
you&mdash;Of the patron of the Slavs&mdash;Of the holy Prokop&mdash;He
who was born in Bohemia&mdash;Who propagated God's
law in a saintly fashion&mdash;Who faithfully fulfilled the
holy law&mdash;Who worked many miracles.... St. Prokop is
of the Slav race&mdash;Born not far from &#268;esky Brod.&mdash;That
village did God well bless&mdash;In which this saint
was born."</p>

<p>The legend then proceeds to tell us of Prokop's youth
and education, laying special stress on the fact that at
the monastery on the Vy&#353;ehrad he received instruction
in the Slavonic language. Prokop obtains great favour
among the monks, who wish to choose him as their
provost. But Prokop flies from all worldly honours
and retires to a desert district, "where is a river, and
that river is called Sazava, and it still flows beneath
the monastery." The meeting between the hermit and
Prince Ulrick is thus described: "The Prince, named
Ulrick&mdash;Called to the hunters, who were running in
every direction&mdash;And speaking to them all said&mdash;'In
what woods shall we hunt?'&mdash;He said, 'We must begin&mdash;Where
shall we begin?'&mdash;'Let us,' he said&mdash;'try the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
hills near the Sazava.&mdash;Into these woods I desire to
go&mdash;Let us go there; that is my counsel.'&mdash;All run after
him; all obey him&mdash;But when they penetrate into the
forest&mdash;They all lose the prince.&mdash;By God's will it
happened&mdash;That not one of them remained with him.&mdash;To
the prince a stag appears, beautiful&mdash;Large and very
fleshy&mdash;Prince Ulrick is not frightened&mdash;And having
his crossbow in his hand&mdash;He wished to shoot the
stag&mdash;Which was running not far from him&mdash;Not fleeing
hastily before him.&mdash;Just as if sense were given it&mdash;It
placed itself on that rock&mdash;Where St. Prokop was
working.&mdash;He was then felling an oak&mdash;And the stag
sprang up behind him&mdash;Turning its antlers towards
him.&mdash;Between the antlers it had a cross&mdash;Prince Ulrick
well noticed this&mdash;Directly he drops his crossbow from
his hand&mdash;And stops his horse&mdash;Seeing this wondrous
animal&mdash;And the meek-faced monk&mdash;The prince begins
to ask the monk&mdash;Having rapidly descended from his
horse&mdash;'Who art thou who lives here in this solitude?&mdash;How
art thou called and what art thou doing here?'&mdash;Holy
Prokop directly&mdash;Answered him kindly&mdash;'I live in
this solitude&mdash;As a sinner, and Prokop is my name.'"
The prince then begs Prokop's forgiveness for having
attempted the life of an animal evidently consecrated to
Christ. He becomes yet more certain of the saintliness
of the hermit when Prokop miraculously transforms into
exquisite wine the water which the prince is drinking.
Ulrick exclaims, "Such noble wine hast thou in this
desert? I have been in many lands, but never have I
drank better wine." He then tells Prokop that he will
build a monastery on the spot where they are standing.
Of this monastery Prokop, in spite of his hesitation,
becomes abbot. The legend then gives an account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
several other miracles wrought by him. Then "in the
year 1054 after the birth of Christ, he was, two days
before his death, informed by a divine vision of his
approaching end." Before dying Prokop foretells that
troubles after his death will befall the monks. Under
the reign of Ulrick's successor the prophecy is fulfilled.
The Slavonic monks are expelled and Germans take
their places. During the first night which the Germans
spend in the monastery Prokop's ghost appears to them,
warning them to leave instantly; he again, equally
without result, repeats his warning on the following day.
Then "he shows himself to them on the third night&mdash;And
shows them his power.&mdash;He begins to speak:&mdash;'Listen,
ye Germans&mdash;I have fulfilled my duty (by giving
them due warning)&mdash;But you heed not my words.&mdash;Not
for you did I prepare this site&mdash;But I founded it for the
sons of my own country&mdash;Not for you, faithless calumniators&mdash;You
are infamous Hungarians<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, come from
anywhere.&mdash;If even the prince has given you this monastery&mdash;It
will to-day be taken from you.&mdash;You would not
listen to good words&mdash;I will now render your dwelling
on the Sazava distasteful to you.&mdash;Quick, delay not your
journey&mdash;Return in haste to Prague.&mdash;After he had said
this, holding a large stick in his hand&mdash;He unmercifully
thrashed the Germans with it."... The legend ends
with the return of the Bohemian monks to the monastery
on the Sazava.</p>

<p>Early Bohemian legends, as already mentioned, are
very numerous. Besides those already referred to, the
legends of the "tears of St. Mary," the "joys of St.
Mary," the "tears of Mary Magdalene," the "legends of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>St. George and St. Anselm," are among the best. The
last-named legend expresses the characteristic opinion
that Judas Iscariot was probably a German! Two allegorical
poems, of a religious character, entitled <i>The</i>
<i>Contest of the Body and the Soul</i> and <i>Truth</i>,
are also very ancient.</p>

<p>Though the chronology of early Bohemian literature
is hopelessly unreliable, it can, speaking generally,
be stated&mdash;leaving the manuscripts of Gr&uuml;neberg and
K&ouml;niginhof out of consideration&mdash;that the existent Bohemian
writings of a secular character are less ancient than
those dealing with entirely religious subjects. Here, too,
the earliest writings have the character of poetic works;
for the first prose writings belonging to Bohemia were
all in Latin.</p>

<p>Among these early works should be mentioned
several poems of an epic character, which are very
similar to the chivalrous poetry of other European
countries. The literature of the period of the Crusades
(wars in which the Bohemians took a considerable part)
possessed, in many respects, an international character.
Knights of many European countries met in Palestine.
A brisk exchange of ideas between men whose tendencies
and ideals were identical was but natural. The
subjects of the songs and epics of chivalrous poetry are
limited in number, and often belong to several countries
when national particularities often influence the details
of the narrative. Such heroes of chivalrous poetry are
Alexander of Macedon, who is conceived as a Christian
knight and a crusader, Tristram and Isolde, and the
other heroes and heroines of the round table; Theodoric
or Dietrich of Berne (Verona), and the other
heroes of ancient Gothic tradition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>In consequence of the geographical position of
Bohemia, these tales reached the country later than
lands lying farther west, and often from German sources.
Yet the prejudiced attempts of German writers to prove
that the Bohemian remains of chivalrous poetry are
adaptations and translations from the German have in
many cases proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p>In consequence of the wholesale destruction of Bohemian
literature, we are here also obliged to found conjectures
on a comparatively small number of fragments.</p>

<p>Of only one of these epic poems has a considerable
portion been preserved. This is the <i>Alexandreis</i>, of
which several manuscripts of different dates are in
existence. From these fragments the erudition of Bohemian
scholars has, to a great extent, reconstituted the
poem: we now possess more than half the poem, and
can, to a certain extent, conjecture what was contained
in the still missing parts. The Bohemian <i>Alexandreis</i>
is undoubtedly an adaptation of the Latin poem of
Philip Gaultier (Walter) de Chatillon, also known from
his birthplace, Lille, as Gualterus de Insulis, who lived
in the twelfth century, and died about the year 1201.
Chatillon's <i>Alexandreis</i>, based on the work of Quintus
Curtius, enjoyed great popularity during the Middle
Ages, and was generally adopted as the classical account
of the career of the great Macedonian. The author
of the Bohemian <i>Alexandreis</i> is unknown, but it is
possible to fix an approximative date for the poem.
It was undoubtedly written during the reign of King
Premysl Ottokar II. (1253-78). Ottokar, who had extended
the frontiers of Bohemia from the Baltic in the
north to the Adriatic in the south, was often compared
to Alexander the Great, and that hero's history, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>fore,
had great interest for the Bohemian writers of that
period. Recent critics have attempted to fix the date
of the <i>Alexandreis</i> yet more accurately. In the years
1264 and 1267 Ottokar undertook crusades against the
heathen Prussians and Lithuanians, and seems even to
have thought of rendering parts of those districts
permanently dependent on Bohemia, thus securing for the
country an outlet towards the Baltic. It is conjectured
that the passage in the account of Alexander's entry into
Babylon, in which the author prays that "God may
grant Bohemia a king who will subdue the Lithuanians,
Tartars" (see later), refers to Ottokar's far-reaching plan.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the author of the <i>Alexandreis</i>
follows strictly in the footsteps of Chatillon, or rather
of Quintus Curtius, to whom so many of the medi&aelig;val
tales about Alexander can be traced. Yet the Bohemian
<i>Alexandreis</i> has not only a distinctly Christian, but also
a national (Bohemian) character. The Persians are
heathens doomed to hell. Margraves, burgraves, and
counts are found in the contending armies. The Bohemian
nobles Jan, Radvan, Mladota, and Radota form
part of Alexander's court. The account of the festivities
on the occasion of Alexander's entry into Babylon (a
portion of which I have translated) describes them as
similar to those which took place at Prague on the
occasion of the coronation of the Bohemian kings. For
Chatillon's hexameters the author has substituted a
rhymed metre, consisting of verses of eight syllables,
which generally, though not always, have a c&aelig;sura after
the fourth syllable. The rhymes are very rugged and
often irregular.</p>

<p>The author's preface begins with a quaint attempt at
disarming his critics. He tells us that Solomon, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
wisest of men, admitted that there were three things,
and even four things that he did not know<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>; "if, then,
he who surpassed all others in wisdom was liable to be
mistaken, then I, should any one doubt my word, need
not be offended; I who compared to him am as a weary
beast to a lion, a wax taper to the sun, or a shallow rivulet
to the sea."</p>

<p>The account of the deeds of the great Macedonian
conqueror strictly follows the medi&aelig;val tradition of
Alexander's career. Beginning with his birth and youth,
the author then gives a detailed account of his education
by Aristoteles and the wise counsel given him by that
philosopher. Then follows a full account of Alexander's
campaigns and victories. Very interesting is the author's
account of his hero's arrival at Troy. He here has an
extensive digression concerning the destruction of that
city, which is not contained in Chatillon's work. It is
curious to meet with the world-old tale of Paris and the
three goddesses in Bohemian literature. The Christian
writer no doubt considered it more seemly to relate the
appearance of the three goddesses in the form of a
dream. He writes: "Now it happened to him (Alexander)
to march&mdash;To the spot where are the bastions of
Troy&mdash;Now the only traces&mdash;Are stones lying on the
ground&mdash;If it does not appear idle to you<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;I will relate
to you&mdash;Why this destruction took place&mdash;Why all this
happened.&mdash;Paris was the king's son at Troy&mdash;Brought
up at home in honors.&mdash;His father and mother&mdash;Out of
love for their child&mdash;Treated him so kindly&mdash;That they
allowed him his will in all things&mdash;The prince prepared
for the chace&mdash;Nothing else was on his mind.&mdash;Then it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>befell&mdash;That when he was riding far away in the woods&mdash;He
went astray from the other hunters&mdash;And his horse
was very weary&mdash;He rode away from the path to a lonely
spot&mdash;Where a fine beech-tree stood in a thicket.&mdash;Throwing
his horse's bridle up to one of the branches&mdash;He
fell asleep under the tree&mdash;It then befell him in this
hour&mdash;That in his dream he saw three goddesses&mdash;The
one who rules love&mdash;The other who rules over wisdom&mdash;And
all warlike knowledge&mdash;The third who rules over
(= disposes of) riches&mdash;And they had a golden apple&mdash;Which
each of them desired&mdash;For on it was written:&mdash;'To
her who is the most beautiful, this shall be given.'&mdash;They
chose him as judge between them&mdash;Saying: 'We
give you this power&mdash;That we may dispute no longer
about this&mdash;Give this apple to whichever one thou wilt&mdash;And
over whatever thing each of us has power&mdash;In
that will she aid you.'&mdash;Then at that moment the prince&mdash;Began
to take counsel with himself&mdash;Saying: 'What is
not due to me&mdash;According to my right as a prince?&mdash;I
have already too great riches&mdash;Also warlike spirit have
I sufficient&mdash;And sense as great as others&mdash;Why then
should I require greater wisdom?&mdash;My fortune also is
favorable to me&mdash;But I should wish to possess a fair
woman.'&mdash;Saying this he awards the apple&mdash;To her who
rules over love."</p>

<p>The author ends his digression with these reflections:
"Oh, erring heart of man&mdash;Oh, restless designs!&mdash;For the
sake of one fair woman&mdash;For indeed her beauty was
great&mdash;The whole world was in arms&mdash;For ten years it
strove in war&mdash;Till in the eleventh year!&mdash;How can we
remember all the ills that then befell Troy!"</p>

<p>It is natural that in a work such as the <i>Alexandreis</i>
dealing principally with the events of war, and written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
for warlike knights, battle-pieces should be numerous,
and indeed constitute the greatest portion of the work.
The following is an extract from one of the best of these
battle-pieces, the description of the battle of Arbela.
Alexander has just killed "Aristomanes, prince of India."
"Easy," cry the Greeks, "easy will be for us glory and
praise&mdash;Now that our king has obtained such glory!&mdash;The
fight was stubborn on both sides&mdash;Not few the
mortal wounds&mdash;They then dealt each other&mdash;When
they first met&mdash;Then the battle-axes, lances&mdash;Drew
blood like water&mdash;And the Greek king rushing at the
enemy&mdash;Struck at the foolish people.&mdash;Meanwhile sword,
lance, and battle-axe&mdash;Aimed at him from every
direction&mdash;Strike his head;&mdash;Yet his mind remains
undisturbed.&mdash;Thus did he bear himself in fight&mdash;As if
he had been forged out of iron&mdash;And it was easy for him
to bear all blows&mdash;While fortune in everything favoured
him.&mdash;Thus did death refrain from him&mdash;Though it struck
down many of the best men there.&mdash;Faros was the name
of one of them&mdash;The second was called Eliphas&mdash;And he
was Count of Egypt&mdash;While the former was Margrave
of Syria&mdash;Both were valorous men&mdash;A great loss by
their deaths&mdash;Befell that heathen king.... But ever,
as was said&mdash;Nothing availed the heathens&mdash;When they
attempted to destroy the Greeks&mdash;Everywhere on the
sand, on the grass&mdash;A stream flowed, rendering the earth
bloody&mdash;In it lay the wretched men&mdash;Like a forest or a
grove that has been felled.&mdash;On both sides hundreds
were killed&mdash;The fourfold gates of hell&mdash;Then were
opened wide&mdash;Such a cry was raised by the devils&mdash;As
if they thought that the earth had resolved&mdash;To drive
them out of hell&mdash;Then the souls flew away quickly&mdash;Like
herds that scatter.&mdash;So many fell that day&mdash;That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
they would have been sufficient to fill Pluto's house&mdash;For
in that battle rarely was any one spared&mdash;Until the
Greeks were tired."</p>

<p>Very interesting is the account of the festivities which
took place at Babylon when Alexander entered the town.
As I have already mentioned, many of the ancient Bohemian
customs on the occasion of the coronation of their
kings are here accurately reproduced. The author first
describes a tournament; he writes: "Already courageously
and in a manner worthy of praise&mdash;Had they fought
bravely&mdash;Striking with their heavy lances;&mdash;Many a one
on both sides, as may be believed&mdash;Had been unhorsed.&mdash;This
knightly pastime&mdash;Lasted for some time&mdash;Till
the king himself gave a sign to the people&mdash;And thus
did the time pass away.&mdash;Then all the more important
citizens&mdash;Nobles and men who held State offices&mdash;Appeared
before their king&mdash;Bringing great presents&mdash;Honouring
his dignity&mdash;Goods of various sorts (they
brought)&mdash;Such as to the human eye&mdash;Give the enjoyment
of pleasure&mdash;For their valuable presents&mdash;They
received much praise.&mdash;In the meantime they lead in
panthers&mdash;Lions and many great ostriches&mdash;And whatever
other birds they had collected.&mdash;The beasts shaking
their cages&mdash;Began to bellow (literally neigh), not liking
their imprisonment&mdash;How could they (the people) have
had anything better?&mdash;Anything more pleasant to see:&mdash;Many
actors and jugglers&mdash;Various boxers&mdash;With
whom the streets swarmed&mdash;Gave them pleasure&mdash;And
they also enjoyed music of various sorts&mdash;The rejoicing
continued so long&mdash;That the whole night passed;&mdash;Then
only did the people go home&mdash;Never, I ween, was
there so great a rejoicing in the world.&mdash;Not even when
mighty Rome&mdash;Chose her king&mdash;Was there so great joy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>&mdash;Nor
did they (the Romans)&mdash;With such overwhelming
honours&mdash;Receive their emperor&mdash;As were then awarded
to him (Alexander)&mdash;And rightly were they given to
him,&mdash;The honours which he then received.&mdash;For starting
with but a small force&mdash;And after enduring many
troubles&mdash;He had struggled so vigorously for his cause&mdash;That
the whole world bowed down before him&mdash;May
God deign to listen to his Christian people and ordain
this,&mdash;That there be such a king in Bohemia!&mdash;I
warrant that then in a short time&mdash;Lithuania and the
Tartars&mdash;Men of whatever name&mdash;The Besermans and
the Prussians&mdash;Also the unconformed (not yet baptized)
Russians&mdash;Would be in such a state of terror&mdash;That
they would accept baptism&mdash;And renounce their idols&mdash;And
this could happen&mdash;Were but one obstacle removed&mdash;That
is, that the Germans, who are strangers here&mdash;Wish
and hope&mdash;That on the bridge of Prague&mdash;[May God
avert this]&mdash;No Bohemian be seen any longer<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;And it
may perhaps soon happen&mdash;That we shall see none of
them (the Germans) any more&mdash;Admire your king, O
city of Babylon&mdash;For, know it, he is worthy of wonder&mdash;He
the conqueror of the whole world&mdash;The terror of
all other kings!"</p>

<p>It has already been stated that the author of the
<i>Alexandreis</i> is unknown. There is, however, no doubt
that the book is the work of a Bohemian noble. The
whole current of thought, the descriptions of battles
and the pomps of chivalry, the author's pedantic
accuracy with regard to the different grades of the
nobility, his dislike of the German townsmen (up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>the time of Hus the Bohemian cities were mainly
inhabited by Germans)&mdash;these and other circumstances
tend to prove that this supposition is correct.</p>

<p>Portions of other epic poems belonging to chivalrous
literature have also been preserved; among them are
some belonging to the circle of legends of which
Theodoric was the centre; such are <i>The Garden of Roses</i>,
<i>Laurin</i>, and others. They are evidently adaptations from
the German, and possess little originality and less interest.
Other fragments deal with the tale of the Round
Table. Among these <i>Tristram</i> and <i>Tandarius and Floribella</i>
may be mentioned. The former poem, as the late
Mr. Wratislaw has remarked, is strikingly similar to
parts of the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>. This specially applies to
one of the fragments which contains a description of the
combat between Tristram and the "noble from Ireland
whose name was Morolt." <i>Tandarius and Floribella</i> also
differs little from many other poems of chivalry. The
heroine is imprisoned and eventually rescued by Tandarius.
Numerous descriptions of tournaments and
single combats fill up the greatest part of the book.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the chivalrous poetry of an
epic character are some early lyric poems that have
been preserved. They, however, all belong to a period
considerably later than the <i>Alexandreis</i>, and Bohemian
critics have no doubt correctly attributed them to the
reign of King John. Here, too, the songs that have
been preserved are not numerous. A favourite form of
these early Bohemian lyrics were the so-called <i>Songs at</i>
<i>Daybreak</i> (in Bohemian <i>Svitanicka</i>), which have a great
affinity to the French <i>aubades</i> and to the <i>albes</i> of
the Proven&ccedil;al minstrels. The motive of these songs,
several of which have been preserved, varies but slightly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
They tell of the parting of two lovers, caused by the
approach of dawn, and of the fears which they express
with regard to the "false gossips," rivals, or inquisitive
people who may be watching them. A translation of
the best of these songs may be of interest.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the refrain "Almighty Lord
God," &amp;c. (slightly varying in the middle of the poem),
recurs three times. It has been conjectured that
these <i>Songs at Daybreak</i>, which were discovered in the
archives of Bohemian castles, were the works of knights
or nobles, men somewhat similar to the "Minnes&auml;nger"
of Germany. By the song which I have translated it
will be seen that these songs are tainted with the peculiar
views concerning conjugal fidelity which characterise so
large a part of chivalrous literature, where Tristram is so
often the hero and King Mark so often the knave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>A few ancient love-songs which have not the character
of the <i>Svitanicka</i> have also been preserved. Of these,
the so-called <i>Cantio Zavisonis</i>, written in Bohemian in
spite of its Latin name, deserves notice. It was formerly
falsely attributed to Zavis of Falkenstein, the lover of
Queen Kunegund, and one of the most celebrated
Bohemian nobles of his time. The fact that Falkenstein
wrote verses in prison shortly before his death (as the
historians tell us) led to this supposition, which is contradicted
by the manner of the poem. Nothing except
the name "Zavis" is known of the author of this
strange love-song, one of the best of early Bohemian
literature. I have translated a few of the best lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Now all joy has left me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Now for me all comfort has ceased,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My heart swims in wistful blood,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>All this because of the beloved one for whom I long.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>By the glance of her eye</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She has sharply struck my heart.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I live in flaming yearning,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My life sickens with love,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>All for the sake of her dear beauty.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *
<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>My longing cannot decrease;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pity me, oh air! pity me, all creation!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Carbuncles, sapphires, and all precious stones,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rays of the sun and everything on the earth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pity me, lilies! pity me, most precious roses!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My beloved wishes to take my little life<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> from me</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If she will not have compassion on me.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Neither the mysterious Zavis nor the author of the
Song at Daybreak which I quoted before were devoid of
poetical talent. But they, as well as other writers whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>I have not specially noticed, were greatly deficient in
the technique of versification; nor did they adhere with
sufficient care to the Western metres and forms of song
which they endeavoured to adopt. These verses, therefore,
lose little by translation. Bohemian writers have
attributed the absence of polish and finish which we find
in these early writings to the fact that, while in France,
Proven&ccedil;e, and Germany the different courts were the
centres of knights' poetry, the Bohemian court at all
periods had a distinctly German character, and favoured
poetry in the national language but little.</p>

<p>The poems of a chivalrous character which I have
noticed above have little distinctly national except occasional
invectives against the Germans. That poetry was
indeed, as noticed before, international in its very essence.
With the decline of this manner of poetry (which in
Bohemia took place about the middle of the fourteenth
century) a different style of poetry arose, which dealt
mainly with national subjects from a national point of
view. It was attempted to acquaint the Bohemians with
the earliest legends and traditions of their race; the
satirical verses which now become numerous have a
distinctly local flavour and deal principally with the
faults and shortcomings of the Bohemian people.</p>

<p>The most important writer of this period is the author
of the so-called <i>Dalimil</i>, a rhymed chronicle of the
events of Bohemian history, which, beginning with the
deluge, ends with the close of the reign of Henry of
Carinthia (1310). The book was mostly written during
the reign of John of Luxemburg, Henry's successor. In
no prince was the cosmopolitan element inherent in
chivalry so thoroughly developed as in King John. The
conduct of a prince who considered that Paris was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
most chivalrous city in the world, and who (anticipating
the modern American) declared that he did not care to
live anywhere except there, who visited Bohemia but
rarely, and then only for the purpose of levying taxes,
and who expressed open contempt for the national
language, was bound to produce a strong national reaction
in Bohemia. The beginning of the great national
movement which culminated in the Hussite wars can
undoubtedly be traced as far back as to the reign of
King John.</p>

<p>The author of the so-called <i>Chronicle of Dalimil</i> is
unknown; the researches of recent Bohemian scholars,
however, prove that he was a Bohemian noble, probably
belonging to the northern districts of the country. From
the contents of the book, which is plentifully supplied
with dates, it can be gathered that the author began
writing in 1308 and finished his work in 1316; of the
events from 1279 downward he writes as an eye-witness.</p>

<p><i>Dalimil's Chronicle</i> is one of the most important works
of Bohemian literature and the first historical work
written in the Bohemian language. Its popularity, to
which the pronounced Bohemian-nationalist views of
the author no doubt largely contributed, was very great.
In proof of this it may be mentioned that, in spite of the
wholesale destruction of Bohemian writings, nine complete
manuscript copies of the Chronicle are in existence;
the oldest of them, curiously, is to be found in the library
of Trinity College, Cambridge. The work was first printed
in 1620, during the brief reign of Frederick of the Palatinate,
but this edition was from political motives destroyed
after the occupation of Prague by the Austrian troops in
the autumn of the same year. The book has been several
times printed and published in the present century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>The author has availed himself largely of the <i>Chronicon</i>
<i>Boemorum</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> of Cosmas, particularly when dealing with
the most ancient records of Bohemia. He indeed in his
preface refers to Cosmas as his principal authority, while
stating that he also had access to the records of various
monasteries, which he enumerates. The intense patriotic
feeling that animated the writer shows very clearly in
his preface. He writes: "Many search for historical
tales&mdash;But they heed not those of their own country&mdash;Acting
thus unwisely and strangely&mdash;Treating their own
nation unfavourably&mdash;For had some one but sought
glory there&mdash;Books about his own country he would
have found&mdash;By which he could have known what is
our race&mdash;Learnt from whence we came.&mdash;I have long
searched for such books&mdash;Ever have I desired&mdash;That
some learned man should undertake&mdash;To connect (in
one work) all the deeds of the Bohemians;&mdash;Up to now
have I desired this&mdash;Till I truly ascertained&mdash;That no
one will undertake (to do) this&mdash;Therefore I must myself
undertake (this task)."</p>

<p>Then follows the passage already referred to, in which
the author declares his indebtedness to Cosmas as well
as to the chronicles of Prague, Breznov, Opatovic, and
Vy&#353;ehrad. The preface ends thus: "Vain words I will
as far as possible avoid&mdash;But yet set down my whole
meaning clearly&mdash;That every one may thus learn more
willingly&mdash;And have more regard for his nation.&mdash;Hearing
my speech, the wise man will become yet wiser&mdash;The
sad man will be freed from sadness.&mdash;I have written this
down plainly&mdash;And I beg that a better man&mdash;May for
the glory of our country&mdash;And because of the craft of
our enemies&mdash;Improve my words by fair rhymes&mdash;And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>embellish the subject with brilliant speech&mdash;But he
should not jeer at me&mdash;Saying, he meddles with what
he does not understand&mdash;Of one thing I am full certain&mdash;That
I have my nation much at heart&mdash;That has
encouraged me in this work&mdash;That has aroused my
energy."</p>

<p>The first part of the book narrates the well-known
tales of the making of Bohemia; the appearance of &#268;ech
and his companions in the land; their settlement near
the mountain Rip; the adventures of Krok, Premysl,
and Libussa; and the deeds of the early Premyslide
princes. All these semi-mythical tales are related in
very much the same manner in which Cosmas had told
them two centuries before, and Hayek was to tell them
two centuries later.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting episodes in the Chronicle
are the descriptions of the murder of Prince Venceslas
by his treacherous younger brother Boleslav, and of the
first meeting of Prince Ulrick and the peasant-maiden
Bozena, whom he afterwards wedded. The peculiar
national prejudice of many Bohemian nobles, founded
not on pride of birth, but on intense racial antipathy,
appears very clearly in <i>Dalimil's</i> account of Prince
Ulrick's marriage. When the nobles reproached him
for his unequal alliance, he answers: "We all descend
from one father&mdash;And he ranks as a noble&mdash;Whose
father had much silver&mdash;And as nobility and peasantry
are thus intermingled&mdash;Bozena shall be my wife&mdash;Rather
would I entrust myself to a Bohemian peasant-girl&mdash;Than
that I should take a German queen as my
wife&mdash;Every heart clings to its nation&mdash;Therefore a
German woman would less favour my language;&mdash;A
German woman will have German servants&mdash;German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
will she teach my children&mdash;Then there will be division
of languages&mdash;And thereby certain ruin to the state."</p>

<p>Of interest also is the author's account of the reign of
the great King Ottokar II. He writes as a violent enemy
of that king, and attributes the disastrous close of his
reign to the fact that he neglected his Slavonic countrymen
and showed too great favour to the Germans.</p>

<p>The geographical position of Bohemia, which is the
outpost of the Slavonic race that advances farthest westward,
has been the cause why that country has always
been the scene of racial feuds. National animosities
were as violent at the beginning of the fourteenth as
they unfortunately are at the end of the nineteenth
century. Ottokar's part in this struggle belongs to the
political history of Bohemia; but it may be incidentally
remarked that, as regards the accusation of having unduly
favoured the Germans to the detriment of his own
countrymen, the greatest of Bohemia's kings has found
an eloquent defender in Palack&yacute;, the greatest Bohemian
historian. The so-called <i>Dalimil</i> thus describes the
close of King Ottokar's reign: "Then the king began to
heed no longer his own (countrymen)&mdash;Towns and villages
he began to give to the Germans&mdash;The Germans
appeared to surround him&mdash;Against the nobles he used
violence&mdash;His officials he instigated against the lords of
Vitkovic&mdash;Against other nobles also he began to use
violence.&mdash;Therefore many nobles became angry&mdash;They
appealed to Rudolph, king of the empire (<i>i.e.</i> of the
Germans), against him&mdash;Saying, 'It is better that the land
should be a desert&mdash;Rather than that by the king's order
the Germans should hold it.'&mdash;Rudolph arrives in Austria&mdash;On
the advice of the Germans the king goes to meet
him&mdash;Then the king makes over all his lands to Rudolph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>&mdash;Rudolph,
keeping the others, makes over Bohemia
and Moravia to the king.... Alas for the noble king&mdash;That
he did not remain true to his own nation&mdash;Thus
would he have obtained great fame&mdash;And also
great riches&mdash;With the help of which he could have
made yet further conquests&mdash;And defeated all his foes.&mdash;But
the king continued to revile his countrymen&mdash;To
injure them whenever he could."</p>

<p>A lengthy account of the grievances of various great
Bohemian nobles against King Ottokar follows. The
writer closes the chapter dealing with that king by these
words: "When, therefore, the king had need of the
Bohemians&mdash;He did not receive willing aid from them&mdash;They
left him when he required them.&mdash;When the king
saw that he could not rely on them in the hour of need&mdash;As
they would not forget their sufferings and the evil
(which they had endured)&mdash;The king said: 'When I
return from the wars&mdash;I will inflict much evil on the
Bohemians&mdash;I will thus stain the Petrin<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> with their
blood&mdash;That no Bohemian will any longer be seen on
the bridge of Prague.&mdash;Truly he could no longer wish to
live.'&mdash;When he spake such words publicly.&mdash;Few Bohemians
did he take with him&mdash;He marched with Germans,
made them his own&mdash;Zavis<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and his brother were with
Rudolph&mdash;This was very harmful to the Bohemian king&mdash;For
he (Zavis) knew the strength of his forces&mdash;And
had friends in his army&mdash;When at daybreak they were
preparing for battle&mdash;Zavis sent a message to the king,
saying&mdash;That if he were gracious to him&mdash;He would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>willing to render him service.&mdash;The king would not hear
of the proposal and advanced&mdash;Saying, 'Rather than
that I did this, I would let myself be killed.'&mdash;Then the
king with his Germans rushed into battle against Rudolph&mdash;And
alas! he fell there&mdash;This misfortune occurred
on the day of St. Rufus, a Friday&mdash;(That holy martyr's
day is a great festival)&mdash;It was in the year since the
birth of the Son of God&mdash;One Thousand Two Hundred
and Seventy-eight." Dalimil's chronicle, as already
noted, enjoyed great popularity in Bohemia for many
years, in fact, up to the sixteenth century, when Hajek's
chronicle took its place. In consequence of this popularity
the chronicle found continuators, and several of
the manuscripts contain additions that are obviously by
a different writer. Shorter tales relating warlike events
in a manner and metre similar to <i>Dalimil</i> also vouch for
the popularity of the chronicle. Such are the tales of
<i>William of Zajic</i>, <i>Ottokar and Zavis</i>, and <i>The Death of</i>
<i>King John</i>, the most interesting one to English readers.</p>

<p>To the early literature of Bohemia a considerable
amount of didactic and satirical poetry also belongs.
The most important of the writers of such verses is
Smil Fla&#353;ka, lord of Pardubic, the earliest Bohemian
writer whose name and personality are well known. He
is the author of the <i>Father's Advice to his Son</i>, of the
<i>New Council</i>, one of the many beast-epics of the Middle
Ages, and of a collection of proverbs. Other satirical
writings, such as the <i>Contest of Water and Wine</i> and
the <i>Groom and the Scholar</i>, were formerly, though incorrectly,
attributed to Smil. All these satirical and
didactic poems have little poetical value, but are of
great interest for the student of the social condition of
Bohemia in the fourteenth century. They contain, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>ever,
a vast amount of allusions of a local or national
character, which render it very difficult to give an
account of them or quote from them without entering
into disquisitions and explanations which would have
little interest for English readers.</p>

<p>Smil Fla&#353;ka, lord of Pardubic, played an important
part in the history of his times. He was born about
the middle of the fourteenth century. From his father,
William, a brother of Ernest of Pardubic, the first
Archbishop of Prague, he inherited very considerable
estates in the districts of Bohemia that are near Pardubic.
During the prolonged struggle between King Venceslas
IV. and the Bohemian nobles, Smil was among those
who opposed the king. He was killed (in 1403) in a
skirmish near Kutna Hora (Kuttenberg) while leading
the forces of the "League of the Lords" against the
citizens of Kuttenberg, who were on the side of King
Venceslas.</p>

<p>Smil's <i>Advice of a Father to his Son</i> is a work of great
interest, as it clearly shows what were then considered
to be the duties of a young Bohemian noble,&mdash;what was
required to make him a perfect gentleman, as a recent
Bohemian writer on Smil has expressed it. Smil begins
by telling his readers that an old nobleman, addressing
his son, who has just attained maturity, and to whom he
presents sword and lance, advises him as to his conduct
in life. The various counsels are then enumerated.
Piety is first mentioned. The father says: "This is my
first advice, O son&mdash;Have God at every hour&mdash;In your
heart with all your might&mdash;Humbly both by day and
night&mdash;Remember, too, His dear Mother&mdash;Her sacred
sufferings bear in your mind&mdash;This you should always
have before your eyes&mdash;Remember this, my son."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Smil is by no means devoid of worldly wisdom;
witness the following passage: "Be liberal as far as is
seemly&mdash;Do not by shabbiness injure your soul&mdash;Neither
must you come to ruin by too great liberality&mdash;Dignified
measure (moderation) is honourable in all things.&mdash;To
your poor friends be amiable&mdash;And take special heed to
be generous to them&mdash;Visit them in their distress&mdash;These
are honourable and knightly debts (duties).&mdash;Reward
those who serve you faithfully&mdash;Who heartily strive for
your glory&mdash;Who wish to raise you higher&mdash;Than your
own power (alone) could reach;&mdash;To these your hand
should not be niggardly.&mdash;To be too haughty, O my
son&mdash;To impose your will on the people&mdash;That I by no
means advise.&mdash;For he who is too proud&mdash;Haughty
more than is well&mdash;He cannot be beloved of the people.&mdash;Even
if by his bravery in battle he could penetrate
victoriously through all ramparts&mdash;Yet by his haughtiness
he vexes&mdash;Every one in every way&mdash;Too great haughtiness,
therefore, does not become a great lord...."</p>

<p>In the last part of the counsel the father advises his
son with regard to his duties towards ladies, repeatedly
inculcating chivalrous devotion to them. He writes:
"Dear son, nearly all have I said&mdash;(To my best knowledge)&mdash;That
is truly necessary for your fame&mdash;But
carefully will I give you&mdash;Yet one more token of knightly
honour.&mdash;You should honour all good ladies&mdash;Defending
with true faith their fair name&mdash;Should any one by
evil speech against women attempt to curry favour&mdash;You
should declare&mdash;That evil speech ever remains evil&mdash;And
that honest words should contradict it.&mdash;According
to honour and wise advice&mdash;You should everywhere
spread their (<i>i.e.</i> the ladies') glory&mdash;You should ever obey
their will&mdash;Be constantly in their service&mdash;And be grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
for their favours.... Therefore, my son, reflect on this&mdash;Consider
the favour of ladies as gold&mdash;And indeed as
worth more than precious stones&mdash;Compared to this
there is&mdash;No thing as precious in the whole world."</p>

<p>Very different from the <i>Counsel of the Father</i> is Smil's
other important work, <i>The New Council</i>, written in 1394
or 1395, somewhat later than the book referred to before.
As I have already mentioned, it is one of those beast-epics
in which medi&aelig;val writers put their social and
political ideas into the mouths of various animals, while
certain animals generally became the representatives of
persons or of classes of the people. Smil's work, one
of the most noteworthy of these writings, is an elaborate
and very striking satire on the condition of Bohemia at
this period. The young lion who, on his accession to
the throne, assembles all animals around him in council,
is undoubtedly King Venceslas IV. of Bohemia; and the
eagle, who is the first to appear before the king, represents
Moravia, the land that for many centuries was
suzerain to Bohemia. To most of the other animals
who (forty-four in number)&mdash;a quadruped always alternating
with a bird&mdash;successively appear before the king,
an allegorical significance can be attributed. The leopard,
who follows the eagle, is the representative of the Bohemian
nobility; and, true to his character, he says to the
king: "Allow no foreigners in your council; put not
your trust in the peasant; rather consult your high-born
and noble lords on the welfare of the land." The wolf
here, as in many other beast-epics, represents the monks;
the fox, who tells the king that "he has need of us, the
lower ones," is the representative of the citizens, who
were always opposed to the nobility, and therefore
favoured the increase of the royal power. The starling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
is the representative of the ordinary court-poets; while
the nightingale personifies Smil himself and those poets
who were enthusiastic for the Bohemian nation. The
praise of poetry which Smil puts into the mouth
of the nightingale is considered the finest part of his
work; and I shall translate a passage from it. The last
"counsel," that of the swan, is couched in deeply religious
language. Smil has indeed in this passage closely
imitated the celebrated hymn, "Dies Ir&aelig;." Of this
"counsel," also, it may be well to translate a small
portion.</p>

<p>Smil in his first verses expounds the motive of his
tale; he writes: "King Lion once upon a time&mdash;Sent
many messengers&mdash;To his princes, to his lords&mdash;To
all counties, in every direction&mdash;He sent for the large
beasts and the small ones&mdash;Saying that they should
all appear before him&mdash;This also he decided, that the
eagle should receive notice&mdash;That, taking all the other
birds with him&mdash;He should appear before the throne
of the king."</p>

<p>The praise of poetry which Smil puts into the nightingale's
mouth is worth quoting; he writes: "Listen
gladly to sweet sounds&mdash;As it is natural to you&mdash;And
is a wholesome pastime.&mdash;Singers, musicians, on whatever
instrument they play&mdash;By these shall thy mind be
strengthened.&mdash;Great is the pleasure afforded to you&mdash;By
the sound of sweet songs&mdash;Particularly at springtime&mdash;When
all plants begin to revive&mdash;When all
creatures are merry&mdash;When May already with manifold
flowers&mdash;Preciously refreshes the whole world.&mdash;The
air everywhere is mild&mdash;Everywhere sweet sounds
are heard&mdash;At day, at night-time, and at dawn&mdash;The
soft song of birds&mdash;(Is heard) in the woods, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
groves, in the fields.&mdash;In such things, O king, seek
comfort."</p>

<p>The swan's song, the last "counsel" in the book, is
also one of the most interesting parts of Smil's work.
He here strongly exhorts the young king to lead a
virtuous life, and vividly describes the terrors of the
day of judgment; he writes: "On that day of wrath,
that day of darkness&mdash;That day of anguish and of rage&mdash;Of
misery, of evil, and of pain&mdash;That sudden day of
wrath and woe&mdash;The day of the awful trumpet and
its roar&mdash;Fearful will be the fate of a sinner."</p>

<p>The "counsel" of the swan, and with it the whole
poem, ends with these lines: "Therefore let every one
seek salvation&mdash;For this is not our lasting dwelling-place&mdash;Let
us here with our whole might&mdash;Strive for our future
happiness&mdash;By doing deeds of mercy, remaining constant
to the true faith.&mdash;Aid us in this, dear Jesus Christ&mdash;May
we be saved from eternal misery&mdash;And rather
live in happiness eternally with Thee.&mdash;Who faithfully
strives for this&mdash;Him help, O Lord God&mdash;Grant him
your grace and eternal life&mdash;Which is always certain for
those who are with Thee. Amen."</p>

<p>Besides the two works mentioned, a collection of
proverbs which goes by Smil's name is undoubtedly a
genuine work of the author. This is not the case with
two satirical poems that were up to recently attributed
to Smil. One of these is the <i>Groom and the Scholar</i>, a
satirical dialogue, which dates from the reign of King
Venceslas IV. The two characters of the dialogue meet
at a tavern, and interchange ideas as to the happiness
of their respective states. The scholar, of course, is one
of the mendicant students so frequent in the Middle
Ages, and the groom taunts him bitterly with his poverty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and misery, and his constant liability to the rod. The
student, on the other hand, reminds the groom of the
hard and lowly work he is obliged to do, and the
scanty wages which he receives. The discussion&mdash;not
unnaturally, the reader of the dialogue will think&mdash;finally
degenerates into a free fight!</p>

<p>The contest of water and wine, also formerly attributed
to Smil, is a curious satirical dialogue between
water and wine regarding their superiority. They are
finally reconciled, and it is stated that "Water is a necessity
for the world, but we require wine also." Among
many other satirical poems, the <i>Satires on Trades</i> should
be mentioned, which give a curious insight into low life
in early Bohemia. They, however, teem with local allusions
and far-fetched puns, and are more interesting to
Bohemians than to other readers. A satirical poem in
dramatic form is the <i>Masti&#269;k&aacute;&#345;</i> (= quacksalver). Of
didactic poems, <i>Cato</i>, an adaptation from the Latin, may
be mentioned. The curious little work contains a collection
of moral precepts which are put into the mouth
of Cato.</p>

EARLY PROSE WRITERS&mdash;THE PRECURSORS
OF HUS</h2>


<p>In Bohemia, as in most countries, we find the national
language employed in poetry long before an attempt is
made to use it in prose. Latin was the language exclusively
used by the writers on history, legal matters,
and theology. The writers indeed were generally
ecclesiastics, to whom the Latin language was necessarily
familiar. Even as late as the second half of
the fourteenth century Thomas of &#352;titn&yacute; was blamed
for using the Bohemian language in his theological and
philosophical works.</p>

<p>A few very early Latin prayers and lives of saints
originated in Bohemia, but the earliest prose work
which possesses general interest is the Latin <i>Chronicon</i>
<i>Boemorum</i> of Cosmas, commonly called Cosmas Pragensis.
Cosmas, "the father of Bohemian history,"
has always enjoyed a great and well-deserved reputation,
and has often been called "the Bohemian Herodotus"
by his countrymen.</p>

<p>We are better informed as to the life of Cosmas than
is the case with regard to most early Bohemian writers.
Writing in 1125, he calls himself an octogenarian, and
it may therefore be considered as certain that he was
born about the year 1045. He was probably of noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
descent, and early in life adopted the ecclesiastical
career. He became canon and afterwards dean of the
chapter of Prague, and accompanied the bishops of
Prague&mdash;whose position then gave them considerable
political importance in Bohemia&mdash;on several missions.
The last chapter of Cosmas' book, dealing with matters
of which he had some personal knowledge, has therefore
far greater value than the rest of the work. The
regulations concerning the celibacy of the clergy were
not at that period, nor indeed far later, observed by the
Bohemian priests, and his ecclesiastical dignities did not
prevent Cosmas from marrying, at the age of forty-one,
Bo&#382;ete&#269;ha, to whom he was sincerely attached, and to
whom he refers in his chronicle as "rerum cunctarum
comes indimota mearum."</p>

<p>It was only after Bo&#382;ete&#269;ha's death in 1117 that
Cosmas&mdash;perhaps to solace his sorrow by study&mdash;began
his great historical work. The writer was then
a man of over seventy years, and traces of senile garrulity
can be found in his book. Still Cosmas appears
to us as a man of great learning and perspicacity,
sharpened, no, doubt, by some knowledge of the practical
politics of his day. With regard to the critical
faculty, he was undoubtedly superior to the contemporary
chroniclers of other countries. In his writings
he almost always distinguishes between popular traditions,
"senum fabulos&aelig; narrationes," for which he
could find no authority, and records which he believed
to be founded on truth. The classical reading of Cosmas
was very extensive for his times. His writings show
a thorough knowledge of the works of Sallust, Ovid,
Virgil, Terence, Lucan, and Horace. Of these, the last-named,
if we may judge by Cosmas' frequent quotations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
appears to have been a special favourite. The Latinity
of Cosmas, if we may venture to employ that word
when dealing with a writer of the twelfth century,
contrasts favourably with that of most of his contemporaries,
and in his works we sometimes meet with
slight but charming reminiscences of the style of more
classic periods.</p>

<p>Cosmas' work consists of three books, which were
written at different periods and at first appeared separately,
each book in the earliest MSS. containing a
separate dedication. Cosmas afterwards published his
work as a whole, dedicating it to his friend Severus,
provost of M&eacute;lnik. The work is written in the chronological
manner universally adopted at that time. In
the earlier part of the first book, which, beginning with
the deluge, deals with the establishment of the &#268;echs
in Bohemia and the reigns of their early princes, Cosmas
wisely abstains from giving any dates. From the deluge
Cosmas proceeds rapidly to the establishment of &#268;echus
and his companions in Bohemia. It is interesting from
the historical point of view to note that all recollection
of the earlier inhabitants of the country, both of the
Celtic and of the Teutonic race, had already faded out
of the memories of the people. Obviously guided by
recollections of his classical readings, Cosmas describes
the time of the first establishment of the Bohemians in
their new homes as if it had been a golden age. "Most
happy," he tells us, "was that age, content with moderate
expenditure, not inflated by restless pride. The
gifts of Ceres and Bacchus were unknown, and indeed
did not exist; their evening meal consisted of acorns
and the flesh of wild beasts; uncorrupted water-springs
afforded them wholesome drink. As the splendour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the sun and the moisture of the water, the fields and
pastures, and even marriage was common to them all....
The use of wool and linen, and indeed of all clothing,
was unknown to them. In winter only they used
the skins of wild beasts and of sheep as clothing. No
one could say of anything, 'It is mine,' but, as is usual
in monastic communities, they said with their mouths,
their hearts, and their deeds, 'Everything we own is
ours (in common).' Their stables had no bolts, and
they did not close their doors on the poor, for there
were neither robbers nor poor.... No arms were to
be seen except arrows, and these they only used against
wild beasts."</p>

<p>In Bohemia, as elsewhere, the "golden age" was of
short duration. Cosmas, continuing his narrative, tells
us the tales of Crocus and Libussa, of Premysl, the
ploughman-prince, and of the foundation of Prague,
which we afterwards find in an enlarged form in the
works of the so-called Dalimil and of Hajek. Many
of these tales, such as that of the ploughman-prince,
are common property of most Slav countries; but the
strange tale of the "war of the maidens," <i>div&#269;i v&aacute;lka</i>,
which is said to have occurred after Libussa's death,
evidently founded on the ancient traditions concerning
the Amazons, is found in the records of no other Slav
country. Bohemian scholars have recently attempted,
with great ingenuity, to trace the manner in which this
Eastern tale found its way to Bohemia.</p>

<p>From the year 894, the date which Cosmas fixes as
that of the conversion of the Bohemian prince Bo&#345;ivoj,
he adopts the chronological system. Cosmas, however,
very frankly admits that many of his statements are
founded on slight and doubtful authority. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
second and third books of his work, on the other hand,
Cosmas claims perfect accuracy. As he writes at the
end of the first book: "Henceforth, with the aid of God
and of St. Adalbert, we intend to narrate those events
which we have either seen ourselves or truthfully
gathered from those who saw them." This statement
is not absolutely true, for Palack&yacute;, who critically
examined the writings of the early Bohemian historians,
has discovered numerous errors, particularly in the
chronology of the second book. The third book, which
begins with the year 1092, and was continued by Cosmas
up to the year of his death in 1125, is the most valuable
and also the most interesting part of the work. As
already stated, Cosmas often accompanied the bishops
of Prague on their travels through Germany, Lorraine,
Italy, and Hungary, and this part of his work gives many
interesting details referring to the social and political
conditions of his times.</p>

<p>The work of Cosmas immediately obtained great and
deserved success, and its popularity continued for a
very considerable period. This is proved by the very
numerous MSS. of the <i>Chronicon Boemorum</i> that are
still in existence. It is therefore not surprising that
Cosmas found many imitators and continuators. They
belonged, as he had, to the ecclesiastical calling, and,
like him, wrote in Latin. The works of these writers
are of interest only to students of Bohemian history;
it will therefore here be sufficient to mention a few of
the most important chronicles. The earliest of these
chroniclers is the writer known to us as the "Canon
of Vy&#353;ehrad;"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> his chronicle continues the work of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Cosmas from the year 1125, and ends with the year
1142. Another also anonymous chronicler is the "Monk
of Sazava." He has incorporated the whole of Cosmas'
chronicle with his work, but has added many interesting
facts, some of which refer to his own monastery. The
monastery on the Savaza had, since the year 1096, been
in the hands of friars who used the Latin ritual, but
our author relates the foundation of his abbey by St.
Prokop, and the subsequent disputes between the
German and Bohemian monks (so vividly described in
the <i>Legend of St. Prokop</i><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>) with an impartiality that
deserves the highest praise. From the end of the year
1125, with which Cosmas' chronicle ends, to the year
1162, the last of which his own work treats, the monk
of Sazava of course writes more independently. His
work is on the whole trustworthy, and he often writes
of contemporary events as an eye-witness. It is, however,
to be regretted that the annals of the last years, when
the monk no longer had Cosmas for a guide, are written
in a briefer, more succinct manner than the earlier parts
of the book, for the writer is here dealing with some
of the most obscure years of Bohemian history. Several
minor chronicles, also written in Latin, and probably
by ecclesiastics, are also to be counted among the continuations
of Cosmas' work. Such chronicles are that
of Vincent, canon of Prague, dealing with the years
1140 to 1167, and that of Gerlach or Jarloch, abbot of
Muhlhausen. Jarloch's chronicle begins with the year
1167, and the existent portion ends with the year 1198.
It is, however, probable that he continued his work to a
far later date, perhaps nearly up to the time of his death,
which only occurred in 1228. After the year 1198 we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>have no knowledge of Bohemia from the writings of
native authors during a considerable number of years.
Somewhat later we find the chroniclers Peter of Zittau,
abbot of K&ouml;nigraal, and Francis, provost of Prague;
the work of the former writer deals with the annals of
Bohemia from 1253 to 1338, while the work of Francis,
beginning with the year 1333, carries on the history of
Bohemia up to the year 1362.</p>

<p>More interesting than any of these chronicles are the
works of several writers who flourished during the reign
of Charles IV. (1346-1378). Though Charles only acquired
the Bohemian language when already grown up,
and always used Latin in his own writings, yet his
interest in the language of his favourite country was
very great. It is during his reign, and probably through
his influence, that we find Bohemian translations of
Latin historical works appearing almost simultaneously
with the Latin originals. Charles IV. himself ranks
among the Bohemian historians. His <i>Commentarius de</i>
<i>Vita Caroli Bohemi&aelig; Regis et postea Imperatoris ab ipso</i>
<i>Carolo conscriptus</i> is of the greatest interest, and gives
an insight into the true nature of the great sovereign
which we scarcely find elsewhere. The book very
clearly shows us Charles's attachment to his country, his
piety, and his strong tendency to mysticism, the latter
a characteristic of the king of which perhaps only
Bohemian historians have taken sufficient account. If it
were not contrary to the plan of this book to give lengthy
quotations from works not written in the Bohemian
language, the <i>Commentarius</i> would certainly deserve a
more extensive notice. The book has unfortunately
reached us in a very incomplete state. It appears probable
that the writer intended to conclude his work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
with his election as King of the Romans; but the part
which is undoubtedly the work of Charles does not go
beyond the year 1340. Additions by a very inferior
writer continue the work up to the year 1346, when
the electors at Rhense chose Charles as King of the
Romans. It appears, however, that Charles had collected
notes in view of continuing his historical work,
and that he made over these notes to Canon Benes
of Weitmil, who afterwards incorporated them with
his own chronicle. The <i>Vita Caroli</i> was translated
into Bohemian very shortly after its appearance, probably
by the so-called "Pulkava." The personality of
"P&#345;ibik, son of Dluh&yacute; of Radenin, surnamed Pulkava,"
was formerly very obscure, and his chronicle was attributed
to a person of the name of "Pulkava of Tradenin."
Recent researches of Bohemian scholars have afforded
us some information as to the career of a man who
enjoyed high favour with Charles IV., and held what
may be called the position of court-historian. P&#345;ibik
was a layman, rector of the collegiate school of St.
Giles at Prague. He took orders later in life and
became rector of the parish of Chudenic, but probably
carried on the duties of his office by means of a substitute.
It was by the direct order of his sovereign
that he composed his Bohemian chronicle, which, beginning,
as was then usual, with the dispersion of
the human race, narrates the history of Bohemia up
to the year 1330. The book first appeared in Latin,
but was almost immediately translated into Bohemian.
Charles took great interest in this work and furnished
the writer with numerous documents, so that he can
almost be considered as his collaborator. Recent
Bohemian writers have gone further, and have sug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>gested&mdash;though
without bringing forward sufficient evidence&mdash;that
Charles was himself the author of the Latin
chronicle, and that "Pulkava" only wrote the Bohemian
translation, or rather adaptation, for the contents of
the two books are by no means identical. This is one
of the many questions concerning ancient Bohemian
literature that is still obscure. Pulkava's work is written
in the same fashion as the work of Cosmas, whom,
indeed, all early Bohemian historians imitated, whether
they expressly called themselves continuators of his
work or not. Published under the auspices of Charles,
Pulkava's chronicle enjoyed great popularity and is
preserved in numerous MSS., from one of which the
Bohemian version was printed in 1786. The work has,
however, little historical value, and the style of the
Latin version is inferior to Cosmas.</p>

<p>Of the many other writers of history who flourished
during the reign of Charles, it will be sufficient to mention
Benes (Benessius) of Weitmil, a canon of the
chapter of Prague. Charles IV., as already mentioned,
furnished the author with many notes, that were incorporated
with his work. The chronicle of Benes,
written in Latin, deals with the history of Bohemia
from the year 1283 to the year 1374, about which time
the author appears to have died. The part of the
work which describes King John's last campaign and
his death at Cr&eacute;cy has great interest, not only for
Bohemian readers. Laurence of B&#345;ezova, who is
generally mentioned in connection with the writers
referred to above, belongs rather to the period of
the Hussite wars.</p>

<p>While Bohemian was at this period, at first only in
the form of translations, taking its place beside Latin as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
a language adapted to historic writing, it was already
extensively used for writings on matters of law. Such
works hardly belong to a history of literature; yet the
<i>Kniha star&eacute;ho p&aacute;na z Ro&#382;mberka</i>, the book of the old
Lord of Rosenberg, deserves mention. It contains an
enumeration of the laws and customs of Bohemia as
they existed in the author's time. It is the oldest prose
work in the Bohemian language, and dates either from
the beginning of the fourteenth or from the last years of
the thirteenth century. Another early legal work is the
<i>V&yacute;klad na pravo zemske</i>, exposition of the law of the land,
which is attributed to Andrew of Duba. Several other
very early Bohemian writings on legal matters have
been preserved.</p>

<p>One of the earliest and most curious prose works in
the Bohemian language is the singular dialogue known
as <i>Tkadle&#269;ek the Weaver</i>. The book was one of the first
that were printed when the revival of the Bohemian
literature in the present century began. It was published
by Wenceslas Hanka<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> in 1824, and was greatly
admired. Recently the value of the book has, I think,
been unduly depreciated. It certainly abounds with
affectations and conceits such as were usual in the literature
of most countries at the time&mdash;about 1407&mdash;when
the book appeared; yet the complaints of the lover sometimes
reveal a touch of real passion, and the style is
generally fluent and lively. The monotony and the repetitions
for which the lovers' long speeches are blamed
are no peculiarity of the <i>Weaver</i> but rather are ever
inherent to the speech of the discarded and distressful
lover. Far inferior to the speeches of the lover are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>answers of the personified Misfortune to whom he addresses
his complaint.</p>

<p>Of the author of this very interesting work little is
known. His Christian name was Ludvik, and he represents
himself as being himself the discarded lover who
addresses his complaint to Misfortune. He adopted the
name of the Weaver, being, as he writes, "a weaver of
learned lines." He was, according to recent research,
not a nobleman of the Bohemian court, as had been
formerly supposed, but a literary man who was in the
service of the Dowager-Queen Elizabeth at K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz,
employed as a "writer" in some not clearly defined
position. While it thus appears that the Weaver was a
man of comparatively humble position, a more thorough
study of the book has also proved that the fair Adli&#269;ka,
who had forsaken him to marry another, was not, as has
been written, "one of the beauties of the Bohemian
court," but that she was (as her lover indeed himself
tells us) employed at that court as a "topi&#269;ka" (literally,
lighter of fires), a word that we must reluctantly translate
by "housemaid". Ludvik is, therefore, yet another instance
of the facility with which a literary man idealises
his mistress. It has been proved in recent years that
the <i>Weaver</i> in many respects resembles a somewhat
earlier German book entitled <i>Der Ackermann aus Beheim</i>,
which dates from the year 1399. Without entering
into the controversy that has arisen on this subject,
it will be sufficient to state that the <i>Weaver</i> is not
an adaptation, far less a translation of the German
work, though there are certainly many resemblances
between the two books. It may be interesting to quote
part of one of the laments which the Weaver addresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
to Misfortune. He thus expresses his grief: "After a
loss a man often incurs mockery; the sorrow of others
is to many an object of ridicule, such as thou hast
bestowed on me, O unfortunate Misfortune! Through
thee this has happened to me, the unhappy and thrice
unhappy weaver. This all know and feel, this they
fully understand. For already have all said and loudly
affirmed it, that my most delightful, most excellent
serving-maid<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> has been endowed with diverse gifts,
happy and most choice; greater were her gifts than
any that Nature has allowed any one to have; for all
these gifts that she had from fortune, she had them
not from fortune only; she obtained them also from
the supreme Creator. Not only was she endowed with
goodly customs, but a shapely form, a beautiful figure,
and noble birth also God gave her, who had chosen her
for her virtues and (who gave her also) much that was
very good, sweet, and honourable; hardly ever has God
given to one person so many remarkable, good, and
prosperous gifts. And yet you mockingly tell me that
my most excellent serving-maid, my most beloved maiden,
is not different from others. And not only this (do you
say), but also that I could find many other matrons and
maids such as she, did I but cast glances around me....
I wonder at this: what devil has sent you to me? what
devil gave you power over me? what devil or what
demon,[2] or what fiend<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> has roused you and instigated
you against me? I wonder indeed at the meaning of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>this. I trust in my Creator for this, that He has not
given you this power, and that you have not from Him
this authority, and that this is by no means just. But
you tell me that God has instructed you&mdash;chosen you
for this! but I know not this; rather do I know that
I have been deprived of all my comfort, of all my
pleasure, of all good merriment; to me is bequeathed
poverty and eternal grief; my name is marked out and
written down in the doleful register of the longing and
anxious ones until I die. Now indeed there is truly
discord between me and the beloved and adored one;
now indeed there is a quarrel worse than all other
quarrels and discords. This indeed may be called
truly discord and anger, which never again will change
to peace. Oh, that I should ever have known what
wrath between two lovers is. Alas and again alas, and
woe to you, wicked, infamous Misfortune! Oh, wicked
Misfortune, now, indeed, through your evil anger all my
happiness, and with it my youth, is at an end. Why
then am I still alive? what can I rejoice over? in what
can I find pleasure? where can I seek refuge in this my
great need? What shall I now love, what can I love
now that everything is lost to me. In what shall I now
find pleasure, what shall render me merry and happy,
when I no longer love her through whom everything
appeared lovable to me. Little now will be my joy, for
little mercy shall I find.... And for what purpose have
you endeavoured to do this, shameful, wicked, false
Misfortune? Alas, alas! Woe, ever woe to thee. Gone
is all my grace, gone are all my many qualities. O
Misfortune, to whom shall I now go for counsel in
this my hateful adversity? to whom shall I complain
of my loss in this my depression and sorrow? I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
no one to whom to complain of my misfortunes, of
whatever nature they may be, except you, evil, disagreeable,
and displeasing Misfortune, from whom I expect
no relief.</p>

<p>"Alas, alas, and again alas! What yearnings have
besieged me, what woe has bound me, what orphanage
(<i>i.e.</i> bereavement) has subdued me! What longings and
more than longings have overwhelmed me, and still
overwhelm me from day to day, from hour to hour, so
that I know of them neither beginning, nor middle, nor
end. I am like a child that has been separated from its
mother before the time, like a kitten which, though not
yet grown up, is deprived of milk. As the colt of an ass
that has not yet acquired strength is driven and forced
to work before the time, thus I, evil Misfortune, am
subject to you and given over to you before the time
and in my youthful years; and still I do not know in
what manner and wherefore and by whose orders. Alas,
alas, O Misfortune! were it but possible that you, instead
of Lot's wife, could be changed into that statue of salt,
then at last your end would be certain. For it is you,
O Misfortune, evil and shameful, and yet again evil
Misfortune, who hast made of me more than a widower,
more than an orphan, more than a man in whom all
hope is dead. Every widower, when he is deprived of
her who comforts him and loses her&mdash;knowing that it
cannot be otherwise, and that his wife cannot return
to him&mdash;gets over it, and so to speak forgets her, if not
for ever, yet occasionally. But how should I forget my
dearest, my most excellent and most beloved serving-maid?
for she is yet alive, she is yet in good health, she
is full of strength; she is as the pastime for another, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
for me. And yet greater therefore is my bitterness, my
sorrow, my anguish."</p>

<p>A short extract from one of Misfortune's replies to the
Weaver will be sufficient. I shall here quote from Mr.
Wratislaw's translation: "How much more fortunate
then dost thou desire to be that I may honour thee more
than the Emperor Julius or the King Alexander, or the
excellent, truly excellent Emperor Charles, at this time
king of Bohemia? who, powerful as they were, could
not at times escape my power and my contrariety.
Prithee, imagine how many of my misadventures have
happened to those only whom thou knowest, and of
whom thou hast heard in thine own days, whether of
higher or lower rank; and neither thou nor any one
else will be able to express in writing or words how
many times this has happened to them.... If thou wilt,
as thou canst, recollect thine own adversities only in
thine own mind, how many of them hast thou also had
from me? For it would have been more proper to cry
out against me about them, or to argue with me about
that which once threatened thy life, thy property, thy
honour, and all the good that thou hadst, and it would
have been convenient to speak of that rather than of that
damsel of thine. Therefore, Weaver, hold thy peace,
speak no more with me of thy darling."</p>

<p>Other early Bohemian prose-writings are the <i>Tale</i>
<i>of Alexander the Great</i>, founded on the writings attributed
to Callisthenes, but probably a translation from
the Latin. It has little in common with the rhymed
Bohemian <i>Alexandreis</i>. The <i>Chronicle of Troy</i>, also one
of the earliest existent works in Bohemian prose, is also
probably a translation from the Latin. The chronicle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
is remarkable as being the first Bohemian work that
was printed (at Pilsen in 1468). These and other translations
which require no special mention prove that
the development of the Bohemian language was proceeding
rapidly at this period.</p>

<p>I shall now refer to a group of writers and thinkers
who are generally known as the precursors of Hus.
This designation is still correct, though more extensive
study of the works of Hus has recently proved it to
be so to a lesser extent than was formerly supposed.
It will be mentioned, when treating of the writings of
Hus, that they show very little trace of the study of
the works to which I shall now refer, while the influence
of Wycliffe, from whom Hus quotes extensively,
is constantly perceptible in his works, particularly in
those written in Latin. Some ideas common to Wycliffe
and Hus can also be traced far farther back; still
many thoughts which we frequently meet with in the
writings of Hus, his indignation against the immorality
and avarice of the clergy, his endeavours to encourage
the study of the Bible and to extend the use of the
national language in the religious services, are clearly
to be found in the writings of his Bohemian precursors.
&#352;titn&yacute;, in particular, was also a precursor
of Hus in that sense that he greatly developed and
perfectioned the Bohemian language, endowing it with
a phraseology such as was necessary for the proper
rendering of difficult theological and philosophical
definitions.</p>

<p>By employing his native language for subjects which
had hitherto only been dealt with in Latin, &#352;titn&yacute; set
an example that was afterwards followed by Hus.</p>

<p>The great prosperity which the wise rule of Charles IV.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
had assured to his country had produced a great change
in the hitherto simple fashion of living of the Bohemians,
and of the citizens of Prague in particular. A more
sumptuous mode of life now prevailed, and the contemporary
writers are eloquent in their references to the
luxurious fashion of dress, the extreme devotion to the
pleasures of the table, and the general immorality of
the citizens of Prague. The clergy, with a few honourable
exceptions, gave by no means a good example
to the laymen. Simony, and immorality&mdash;according
to the Catholic creed a far greater offence on the part
of a priest than of a layman&mdash;were almost general,
both among the monks and the members of the secular
clergy.</p>

<p>This deplorable condition of his beloved Bohemia did
not escape the notice of Charles IV., whom his countrymen
in his lifetime already described as "Otec Vlast&iacute;"
(=Pater Patri&aelig;). Hoping to improve the moral condition
of the country by calling in foreign priests, Charles
in 1358 invited the Austrian monk Conrad Waldhauser
to Bohemia. Conrad, a native of Upper Austria, had
lately attracted great attention by the eloquent sermons
he had preached at Vienna. A German by nationality,
Conrad was ignorant of the Bohemian language, but
though he was thus unable to make himself understood
by the mass of the people, the impression produced by
his sermons was none the less very great. The educated
citizens of Prague were then, as now, almost as familiar
with the German as with their own language. Graphic
accounts of his eloquent denunciations of the corruption
and luxuriousness of his age have been preserved; they
sometimes read like a modern account of a revival
meeting. The Teyn Church, where Conrad preached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
soon became too limited for his audience; people
assembled in squares and public places to listen to his
sermons. The ladies of Prague discarded their jewellery
and sumptuous clothing, while many men publicly confessed
their sins. Though Conrad's preaching was in
the strictest conformity with the teaching of the Church
of Rome, he yet incurred the hostility of the monks,
particularly the Dominicans and the Augustines. The
protection of Charles, however, ensured his safety, and
Conrad's death, in 1369, put a stop to the controversy
which his sermons had caused. Waldhauser has left
a considerable number of Latin works; of these, the
<i>Postilla Studentium Sanct&aelig; Universitatis Pragensis super</i>
<i>evangelia dominica</i> and the <i>Apologia</i>, which contains his
defence against the attacks of the monks, are the most
important.</p>

<p>Among those on whom the preaching of Conrad
Waldhauser produced a strong and permanent impression
was the Moravian <span class="smcap">Mili&#269;</span> of Kremsier, who, after
Conrad's death, became his successor as rector of the
Teyn Church at Prague. We find a considerable
amount of information concerning Mili&#269; in his biography,
contained in the <i>Miscellanea</i> of the learned
Jesuit Balbinus. This biography, which dates from the
second half of the seventeenth century, written, if not by
Balbinus himself, by a member of his order, is noticeable
for its conscientious impartiality. It is the foundation
of all the more recent notices of Mili&#269;. The date of the
birth of Mili&#269; is unknown; we only learn that he was
of humble origin, and was probably born in the town
of Kremsier in Moravia. He took orders early in life,
probably in the year 1350. From the year 1360 downward
he seems to have held an important official position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in the chancery of Charles IV.; somewhat earlier he had
already become archdeacon and canon of the cathedral
of St. Vitus at Prague.</p>

<p>The ever-increasing reaction against the corruption of
the times, which had already found expression in Waldhauser's
sermons, caused Mili&#269; in 1363 to renounce all
these dignities. In spite of the remonstrances of his
Archbishop, Ernest of Pardubic, he decided to devote
himself entirely to the preaching of the word of God.
He first preached for a short time in the small town of
Bischof-Teinitz, and then in several churches at Prague.
The sermons of Mili&#269; vigorously inveigh against the
immorality and corruption of the times, and do not
spare the secular clergy and the monks. As Mili&#269;
preached in Bohemian, his teaching was accessible to
the great mass of the people, whom Conrad's German
sermons had not reached.</p>

<p>The constant contemplation of the evils of his time,
of poverty and vice as he saw them in the streets of
Prague on the rare occasions when he left his studies
for a few moments, produced a remarkable, though not
at that period exceptional, effect on the imaginative mind
of Mili&#269;. It seemed to him that all the preliminary
symptoms described in the Revelation of St. John had
already occurred. He therefore came to the conclusion
that Antichrist was about to appear&mdash;he is said to have
fixed on the years 1365 to 1367 as the date of his arrival&mdash;and
sometimes even that he had already come. In a
sermon preached before Charles IV., Mili&#269; openly denounced
that sovereign as the "greatest Antichrist."
Though he was imprisoned in consequence of this sermon,
Mili&#269; remained but a short time in prison. The
magnanimous prince condoned the offence against his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
person in consideration of the great benefits which
Mili&#269; had conferred on Bohemia, both by his eloquent
preaching and by the example of his own spotless and
ascetic life. In 1367 Mili&#269; proceeded on a journey to
Rome, where Pope Urban V. was then expected from
Avignon; he wished to inform the Pope of his conviction
of the impending end of the world and arrival
of Antichrist. Mili&#269; arrived in Rome before the Pope,
and, as he himself tells us in his <i>Libellus de Antichristo</i>,
he caused a placard to be published on the
doors of St. Peter's Church announcing that he would
shortly preach a sermon declaring that Antichrist had
come. Mili&#269; was immediately arrested in consequence
of this act, and imprisoned in a monastery of the
Minorite Friars. The errors in doctrine which he was
accused of were probably a mere pretext for proceeding
against a man whose eloquent sermons against the
avarice and immorality of the clergy had rendered him
obnoxious to many monks. As the biographer of Mili&#269;
tells us, "The friars of the mendicant orders were greatly
incensed against him (Mili&#269;) because of his sermons on
the admission of simoniacs to religious orders, and on
the possession of worldly goods by clerical persons, both
men and women. He was therefore thrown into heavy
bonds, together with Theodoric the hermit, a priest of
saintly memory, who had accompanied him."</p>

<p>Eventually Mili&#269; and his companion were released by
order of Pope Urban, who had meanwhile arrived in
Rome. They returned to Prague towards the end of the
year 1368, and were received with great enthusiasm by
the people. The citizens of Prague rejoiced all the more
on the return of their beloved preacher because during
his absence they had often heard the mendicant friars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
announce from the pulpit, "Beloved brethren, very soon
Mili&#269; will be burnt!" After his return to his native
land, Mili&#269;, who in 1369 succeeded Waldhauser as rector
of the Teyn Church at Prague, continued to devote his
life to preaching and to good works. He devoted much
energy to rescue work, and reclaimed a very great number
of fallen women, for whom, aided by gifts from
pious citizens of Prague, he founded a refuge, to which
the name of Jerusalem was given. The ascetic and
saintly life of Mili&#269; did not, however, disarm his constant
enemies, the mendicant friars. In 1374 a new
accusation against him, consisting of twelve "articles",
was brought forward, and Mili&#269; travelled to Avignon
to defend himself before the Papal See. Evidence
as to the result of the trial is very uncertain, but
on the whole it appears that the views of Mili&#269; were
favourably received at Avignon; but the time was
now near when he would be beyond the reach of all
earthly jurisdiction. Mili&#269; died at Avignon, probably in
June 1374.</p>

<p>Of the literary works of Mili&#269; we unfortunately possess
very scanty remains. It is certain that copies of his
Bohemian sermons were circulated for a considerable
time after his death, but all trace of them has disappeared
long since. If we consider the great eloquence
which all contemporary writers attribute to Mili&#269;, this
cannot be sufficiently regretted. The Bohemian book
entitled <i>Of the Great Torments of the Holy Church</i>, which
has often been attributed to Mili&#269;, is really a work of
Magister John of P&#345;ibram. Of the numerous Latin
writings of Mili&#269;, only a few, of which the <i>Libellus de</i>
<i>Antichristo</i> and the <i>Postilla</i> are the most important, have
been preserved. The biographer of Mili&#269; has stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
very frankly the reason why so many of his works are
lost. He writes: "Mili&#269; wrote much, and because he,
perhaps too audaciously, attacked the vices of the clergy,
and those of the mendicant friars in particular, the Hussites
(as it is the custom of heretics) praised him as if he
had been a friend of their sect, and used his statements
as arguments for their own doctrines. Therefore Archbishop
Zbynek of Hasenburg caused the writings of
Mili&#269; to be publicly burnt on a pile, together with those
of other heretics."</p>

<p>It is certainly principally through the example of Mili&#269;
that the better known <span class="smcap">Thomas of &#352;titn&yacute;</span> received the
first impulse towards writing his now celebrated works.
&#352;titn&yacute;, indeed, himself writes: "Had it not been for the
priest Mili&#269;, perhaps all these books which I have written
would not have existed."</p>

<p>Thomas of &#352;titn&yacute; was born in 1330 or 1331 at &#352;titn&yacute;,
a small castle or "tower," to use the Bohemian designation,
in Southern Bohemia, which appears to have been
in the possession of his family for some time. At a very
early age, probably shortly after its foundation in 1348,
&#352;titn&yacute; visited the University of Prague, where he remained
for some years devoting his time to the study
of theology and philosophy. He did not, however, seek
academic honours, and thus incurred the enmity of the
"magisters" of the University, who considered him as
an intruder on their domain. Their indignation was increased
by the circumstance that &#352;titn&yacute; wrote in Bohemian
at a time when Latin only was considered to be
the fitting language for those who treated the subjects
on which &#352;titn&yacute; wrote.</p>

<p>His theological and philosophical studies did not,
however, so completely engross the interest of &#352;titn&yacute;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
that he did not listen attentively to the sermons of the
famous preachers whose eloquence was then attracting
the attention of the citizens and students of Prague.
He indeed tells us, in the preface to his book <i>Of</i>
<i>General Christian Matters</i>, that this (his first original)
work contained "what he heard at sermons and from
learned men, as well as what he had conceived in his
own mind." In his <i>Discourses for Sundays and Feast-days</i>,
&#352;titn&yacute; refers more precisely to the sermons which
he had heard at Prague. Alluding to the attacks which
had been made against his own works, he writes:
"Thus within my own recollection the devil incited
many against Conrad, that noble preacher of God's
truth, because he showed up the craftiness of a false
priesthood, and because he taught God's truth. Thus
also have they acted towards the good Mili&#269;, and
evil people still speak evil of him, but (they speak)
injustice."</p>

<p>At a time which cannot be exactly ascertained, but
which was probably somewhat later than the generally
accepted date, 1360, &#352;titn&yacute; left Prague and returned to
his home. After the death of his parents he administered
the little family estate, and continued living there
for some time with his three sisters. He married about
this date, but in 1370 was already a widower. He had
several children, for whose benefit he first began writing,
though the later editions of his works are evidently
written for a wider circle of readers. &#352;titn&yacute; outlived all
his children except his favourite daughter Anne (Ane&#382;ka),
who was his faithful companion during the last years of
his life. In 1381 &#352;titn&yacute; returned to Prague, and now
devoted his time entirely to his studies. After his death,
in the year 1401, his daughter Ane&#382;ka occupied part of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
house next to the Bethlehem Chapel, where Hus was to
begin preaching in the following year. It is known that
several pious ladies lived in community in a house near
Hus's chapel, and a letter addressed to them by him has
been preserved. If, as is probable, Ane&#382;ka of &#352;titn&yacute;
was one of these pious ladies, the fact forms an interesting
link between Thomas and his greater successor.</p>

<p>&#352;titn&yacute; did not begin writing early in life. His earliest
works, translations from St. Augustine, St. Bonaventura,
and other writers, date from about the year 1370. His
first original work, the books <i>Of General Christian</i>
<i>Matters</i>, one of the two on which his reputation as a
Bohemian writer mainly depends, appeared in 1376. It
is, however, certain that he had in 1374 already published
several smaller tracts or pamphlets that were
incorporated with his larger work. The books <i>Of</i>
<i>General Christian Matters</i> are therefore rather a collection
of minor writings, some of which had already
appeared, than a work written from the first on a settled
plan and with a continuous range of thought. It was
a peculiarity of &#352;titn&yacute; that he constantly re-wrote his
books, changing their contents very considerably. Of
his first book we possess four different MSS., differing
considerably. The last, published under the new name
of the <i>Books of Christian Instruction</i>, appeared only in
1400, a year before the author's death. In 1852 Erben
edited and published the books <i>Of General Christian</i>
<i>Matters</i>, following the readings of the best MSS. His
work includes a biography of &#352;titn&yacute;, which, though
recent research has proved that it contains a few minor
errors, is still of the greatest value.</p>

<p>The books <i>Of General Christian Matters</i> possess in
Erben's edition two prefaces: the first is addressed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
&#352;titn&yacute;'s children, the second to the larger circle of
readers for whom the later editions of his works were
intended. In the first preface &#352;titn&yacute; gives us a general
account of the contents of his work, informing us that it
will consist of six books.</p>

<p>The first, "Of faith and of hope and of love."</p>

<p>The second, "Of virgins and of widows and of married
people."</p>

<p>The third, "Of the master of a family, of the mistress,
and of the household."</p>

<p>The fourth, "How the nine orders of people bear the
similitude of the nine choirs of angels."</p>

<p>The fifth, "How the devil tempts us."</p>

<p>The sixth, "How we purify ourselves from our
sins."</p>

<p>In his second preface &#352;titn&yacute; defends his resolution to
use the Bohemian language in his writings. "Those
who blame Bohemian books," he writes, "perhaps wishing
alone to appear learned, will do well to fear God's
vengeance, and to remember how guilty those are who
would stop letters and needful messages contained therein;
thus preventing the Lord God, the Eternal Bridegroom,
from instructing His bride in His will, and
comforting her in her distress." &#352;titn&yacute;'s views on this
subject will remind English readers of those of his
contemporary Wycliffe. The second preface also contains
a passage showing the great importance which
&#352;titn&yacute; attached to the reading of the Scriptures; &#352;titn&yacute;'s
teaching, as indeed that of all the Bohemian reformers,
differs greatly from that of the Church of Rome on
this important point. He writes: "This also mark
carefully, beloved brethren, that the Holy Scriptures
are, as it were, letters sent to us from our home; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
our home is heaven, and our friends are the patriarchs
and prophets, apostles and martyrs, and our fellow-citizens
are the angels with whom we ought to be, and our King
is Christ."</p>

<p>The first and last books of &#352;titn&yacute;'s work are of a purely
theological character, differing thus from Books II. and
III., which contain much shrewd advice of a more
worldly character, though always founded on a distinctly
theological basis. &#352;titn&yacute; had not, when writing
this book, reached the height of scholastic learning which
he afterwards attained in his <i>Besedni Re&#269;i</i>. The beginning
of the first chapter of the books <i>Of General Christian</i>
<i>Matters</i> is a good specimen of &#352;titn&yacute;'s earlier
manner of writing on theological subjects. He writes:
"Scripture tells us, 'Without faith it is impossible to
please God', just as it is impossible to build a house
without a foundation. Therefore, he who would have a
firm house must first put up a firm foundation. And if
we would have fruit, it must first originate from the root.
And although the root in itself is not beautiful, yet all
the beauty of stem and fruit originate from it. Thus, if
there were no faith, all things would be useless for our
salvation; without faith, indeed, other good things could
not exist. For faith is the foundation and root of everything
that is good, though its beauty is not in itself so
evident, yet could there be neither hope nor love without
faith. And how can I hope for anything if I do not
first believe that it exists. Therefore it is necessary that
whoever wishes to be saved should hold the common
faith of Christianity."</p>

<p>The second book <i>Of General Christian Matters</i>, as
already mentioned, differs considerably from the first.
&#352;titn&yacute; begins by telling us that "after having finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the first book, which deals with the three general matters
that are necessary to all, of whatever condition they may
be, and without which no one can be saved, I have
written for you this second book. It deals with purity,
and how it should be preserved by those who wish to
dwell with God in His kingdom, in whichever of the
three conditions<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> they may belong. For that heavenly
city, the godly, holy, New Jerusalem is thus ruled, and is
so very pure that, since the beginning of ages, nothing
impure has entered it, as indeed the holy St. John had
declared in the Book of Secret Revelation."</p>

<p>&#352;titn&yacute;'s book, <i>Of Virgins, of Widows, and of Married</i>
<i>People</i>, is written from a highly moral and wise point of
view, but he deals with his subject in a somewhat outspoken
manner, and caution is often necessary when
quoting from it. It is interesting to find in the writings
of a moralist of the fourteenth century views as to the
relative position of the sexes similar to some that have
quite recently given rise to considerable controversy.
In the chapter entitled, "What those who wish to get
married should beware of," &#352;titn&yacute; writes: "To those
maidens who seek a husband, and to bachelors also, will
I give this advice, that every young man should preserve
himself for his bride free from all impurity as completely
as she does so for him; for it is God's law that no man
should outside of the bonds of matrimony commit any
offence with any woman. For as a young man would
be displeased should the maiden whom he wishes to
marry quit the state of virginity, in the same manner he
also should preserve his innocence. A man indeed is
stronger than a woman, and as it is shameful for a virgin
to leave her state except through matrimony, thus before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>God it is no lighter sin for a man. And thus it is
beseeming for both man and woman to preserve themselves
pure till the time of their marriage, and to prepare
themselves for it by penitence, for marriage is a
sacrament."</p>

<p>Very quaint is the part of the second book which
deals with inequality between married people. &#352;titn&yacute;
writes: "It is necessary that those who wish to marry
should all seek their equals, so that inequality may not
cause discord and displeasure. If you are young, beware
of old people, and one of noble birth should seek his
equal, for often evil is caused by that discord (which
arises) when those who are very unequal marry. If an
old man marries some one younger, he ever fears that
the younger one may not love him, and being therefore
anxious about this, he does not feel complete love for
his partner, for where there is suspicion there cannot be
complete love. Also the humours of the young do not
please the old, nor those of the old the young. Some
one indeed said, and he spoke the truth, 'When I was
young the old people did not please me, and now that I
am old, the young people do not please me.' And even
if an old man does not displease a young wife, and even
if she is good, yet will she not be free from the lies of
evil people. They will indeed give her evil advice, saying,
with mischievous intent, 'What an old husband you
have!...' And then evil people will in the fields sing
songs about them, the devil instigating them to do so,
for he wishes to corrupt a good woman, to bring before
her mind what she had not thought of, so that she may
be seized by longing. And it will be precisely the same
thing with a young man who has an old wife. Jesting
with them, people will say to him, 'There is your beauty!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
why, it is your mother!'" In this book &#352;titn&yacute; constantly
praises the state of celibacy, strictly in accordance with
the doctrine of the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>The third book, which, as already stated, treats "of
the master of a family, the mistress, and the household,"
contains much wise and homely advice, and incidentally
throws considerable light on the family life of a
Bohemian country gentleman in the fourteenth century.
The position of the head of the family is thus defined:
"Every landowner is the master of his servants, and
should restrain them from everything that is evil: he
should first attempt to do this by kindness; if he cannot
at once put a stop to evil habits, he should endeavour
to do so gradually, but in no case allow any new evil
habit to spring up. If kindness does not succeed
with them (the servants), then show your right to rule
(over them). Remember always that that priest Eli in
the Old Testament was indeed good himself, but his
sons did evil. He, it is true, said to them, 'You do
evil,' but he did not manfully punish them for their
misdeeds. He thus incurred God's wrath, and was
given as an example to all fathers and heads of families
who do not heed what the members of their households
do. But a master of a household must beware
of sudden, useless anger. If he cannot entirely get rid
of anger, let him at least be softened, and he should
be cruel neither to his servants nor to his wife, remembering
that God is your only Lord and theirs also.
On this, too, should every one reflect, that it is improbable
that any one be without faults; and it often
happens that when you will not pass by a single fault,
perhaps not a serious one, you either spoil (the servant)
yet more, or you are obliged later to overlook more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
serious faults in another (servant whom you take in
the place of the former one). Thus the tilter must
in tournaments overlook some faults in his charger, if
but he is on the whole serviceable."</p>

<p>&#352;titn&yacute;'s work, like those of all moralists of all periods,
contains many reflections on the vanity of the female
sex. He writes: "St. John Chrysostom tells us that if
a man has a dissipated wife, he should not forbid her
everything at a time, lest she become refractory, but
from those things that are, as it were, most serious,
from those let him first try to dissuade her. If she
paints herself, then remark before her what a shameful
thing it is to grease yourself in a nasty manner,
or to cram the hair of others on your head; (also
remark to her), often one thus acquires shame while
wishing to receive honours. If wise men remark these
things on her, they will take her for a mad woman,
and other women, who perhaps have some grudge
against her, will, even though they praise her, betray
her and make fun of her, and often her own servants
will be obliged to hide themselves from shame of this
(their mistress's appearance). In fact, while wishing to
appear young, she becomes aged in consequence of this
painting."</p>

<p>The leading idea of the fourth book <i>Of General</i>
<i>Christian Matters</i> is one which we meet with very often
in &#352;titn&yacute;'s works, but which he has perhaps developed
here more clearly than elsewhere. It is the mystic idea
of the analogy which, according to &#352;titn&yacute;, exists between
the different conditions of men and the various choirs of
angels. He writes: "It is my duty&mdash;as indeed I promised
in the preface to these books&mdash;to explain in this
my fourth book in what manner the conditions of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in this world are similar to the various choirs of the
angels; but let no man attack me, as if I had said that
such or such people of this or that condition will be in
the same choir, as angels of any particular class. It will
be well for them if they obtain heaven; but whether a
man of this or that condition will be in this choir or
that, that is a matter which I cannot judge. Yet in this
world certain conditions of men are more similar to
particular choirs of angels than others. And indeed it
often happens that some common little peasant<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> or small
tradesman has greater love for God than some monk.
Yet both will be with God, but I do not know in which
choir each of them will be." &#352;titn&yacute; then proceeds to
address admonitions to the divers classes of men. The
first class mentioned are the priests and monks, whom
he compares to the cherubims. The somewhat lengthy
discourse about the monks is very interesting, and I shall
quote a portion of it in Mr. Wratislaw's translation.
&#352;titn&yacute; writes: "And thus they have fallen away in love;
they have not the peace of God in their minds; they do
not rejoice with God in devotion, but quarrel, hate each
other, condemn each other, priding themselves against
each other; for love has sunk low in them on account
of avarice, because they have forsaken God for money,
breaking His holy laws and the oath of their own promise.
And besides this (which is the most dreadful
wickedness), they are irritated, they are annoyed at every
good preacher or every good man who understands their
error; they would gladly make him out a heretic that
they may have greater freedom for their cunning."</p>

<p>The fifth and sixth books <i>Of General Christian Matters</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>again deal, like the first one, with purely theological
subjects. It will be unnecessary to deal with
them in detail, as &#352;titn&yacute;'s later work gives us a clearer
insight into his theological views. It is easily noticeable
that &#352;titn&yacute;'s studies gradually become more profound,
and there is a marked difference between the simple and
homely manner in which the books <i>Of General Christian</i>
<i>Matters</i> are written and the more learned and more
brilliant style of the <i>Re&#269;i Besedni</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Re&#269;i Besedni</i>, which we may translate into
English by "Learned Entertainments," also known as
<i>Rozmluvy n&aacute;bo&#382;n&eacute;</i>, "Religious Conversations," is the
second great work of &#352;titn&yacute;, and according to most
Bohemian critics his masterpiece. A considerable
number of MSS. containing the "Religious Conversations,"
both separately and together with the other
works of &#352;titn&yacute;, have been preserved, and we have two
versions that differ considerably, the author having
rewritten his work as he did the books <i>Of General</i>
<i>Christian Matters</i> also. Extracts from the book were
printed some years ago, but it was only in 1897 that
Professor Hattala published a complete edition of the
<i>Re&#269;i Besedni</i>. The work is, like all the writings of &#352;titn&yacute;,
mainly a theological treatise, but philosophy, then of
course the handmaiden of theology, has a considerable
share in this book. The study of Aristotle and of numerous
scholastic writers is very evident, but, speaking
generally, &#352;titn&yacute; must be classed among the realists in
distinction from the nominalists. He has, however,
incorporated with his book such numerous quotations,
or rather extracts, from other writers, that his system
appears somewhat eclectic.</p>

<p>The general purpose of the book is an attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
define the personality of God and His attributes according
to the system of medi&aelig;val scholasticism. Faith
(V&iacute;ra) here, as in all &#352;titn&yacute;'s works, is assumed as
existent, and only incidentally is an attempt made to
reconcile religion with science. The science of course
is that of the fourteenth century, which scarcely knew
the words with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Greek endings each the little passing bell</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That signifies some faith's about to die.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#352;titn&yacute;'s book, treating of abstract matters such as had
never before been dealt with in Bohemian, is yet written
in a clear, lucid, and forcible manner, and it is perhaps
doubtful whether any other modern language had at that
period arrived at a sufficient degree of development to
produce a similar work on subjects which medi&aelig;val
custom reserved to the Latin language. In this respect
&#352;titn&yacute; was a true precursor of Hus, and Palack&yacute; has
rightly said that a nation which produced and understood
such a writer as &#352;titn&yacute; could not henceforth be
called rude and uncultivated. The portion of this work
which has principally attracted the attention of Bohemian
scholars is that dealing with Kr&aacute;sa (beauty), or rather,
as &#352;titn&yacute; words it, "the wisdom of God, as it is shown
to us in the beauty and splendour of creation." It is impossible
to quote detached passages from this treatise,
as it may be called, which is contained in chapters ix.
to xii. of &#352;titn&yacute;'s book, nor are these chapters perhaps
specially characteristic of the general purpose of &#352;titn&yacute;'s
work. Some of the ideas expressed in these chapters
are considerably in advance of the times, and his theories
sometimes recall the views of modern German writers
on &aelig;sthetics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Re&#269;i Besedni</i>, in Professor Hattala's edition, contains
two prefaces. The first, by an unknown writer,
gives a few interesting details concerning the author of
the <i>Re&#269;i Besedni</i>; it tells us "that during the reign of
Wenceslas of Bohemia, the fourth of that name, there
lived a renowned knight, Thomas of &#352;titn&yacute;, a good man
of letters, honourable in his times and irreproachable
in his noble life up to his death. Leading a pious and
peaceful life, he composed these books in the Bohemian
language.... Possessing a sharp intellect, he produced
beautiful, enchanting works, in which he used the writings
of the Old and of the New Testament, and of the
holy fathers."</p>

<p>The second preface, by &#352;titn&yacute; himself, explains his
reason for writing his work in the form of a dialogue
between father and son. "Thinking then and remembering,"
he tells us, "how pleasant it was to me in my
youth to listen to my father or mother when they talked
on Christian matters, and how it was through them that
I acquired some knowledge of Scripture, I devised these
books, (written) as if children questioned their father and
he answered them."</p>

<p>A quotation from the first chapter of the <i>Religious</i>
<i>Conversations</i> will be interesting as showing the manner
in which &#352;titn&yacute; opens up the discussion of his difficult
subject. The chapter entitled, "How the children now
begin to question their father as to what God is and
how He can be known to us," begins with the following
question: "Dear father,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> we would be glad to ask
you, and to understand, what God is?" The father
answers thus: "O children, you have asked a short,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>but far-reaching and very sublime question. Our intellect
cannot err in believing that God exists. All creation
proclaims that God is (its) creator; for no thing
has made itself. Therefore all men, heathens, Jews,
Christians, heretics, and philosophers, hold (= consider)
something as (being) God. But what God is, that the
mind of men does not fathom! Therefore it can be said
that God is the ineffable Supreme Being, than whom
nothing better, nothing more blissful, nothing more
majestic can be imagined, nor indeed anything as good,
as blissful, as majestic. For herein He (God) rises above
all comprehension, above all minds of men and angels;
He is always more excellent than any one can express
or imagine. Thus will you ascertain what God is not,
but you cannot attain to the knowledge of what He is.
For whatever may be the highest majesty a man can
imagine, yet He (God) is above this. If a man attains
to as high a heart as he can, yet God will be raised
above that. Thus many heathen errors and heresies
arose, because men having in their minds imagined God
in this or that fashion, they then said, 'This is God.'
This indeed is true sense, to know our folly and ignorance,
(wherefore) it is impossible for us to gaze on the
brightness of solemn divinity, and, as it were, on the
spiritual splendour of inward light, in which resides
God, to whom we cannot accede. Rather let us in
meekness, holding the strong and true Christian faith,
merit that we may once contemplate our God, through
our Lord Christ, when in that eternal kingdom of His
our eyes shall be entirely and truly cleared. Let not
sin so entirely blind us that we&mdash;God forbid it!&mdash;for
some reason or other forget God, not loving Him in
true faith above everything else. For the Scripture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
sayeth, 'If you do not believe, you will not understand.'
Therefore, children, it beseems you to think and speak
of so sublime a subject with awe and dread and discretion,
and to listen with attentive ears and a pious heart,
with love and not from frowardness."</p>

<p>Chapter xxii. of the <i>Re&#269;i Besedni</i> strongly brings
out the acumen and lucidity with which &#352;titn&yacute; elaborated
his often difficult theological definitions. The
comparisons by which he endeavours to render clearer
the dogma of the Trinity are very striking. The chapter
begins as usual with a question: "How then did it
happen that only the Son of God accepted human
nature in the unity of His person?" The father answers:
"The Father or the Holy Ghost could have done so,
as well as the Son. But the Lord God wished thus to
accomplish this; thus in the council of all the persons
of the glorious Godhead, the Holy Trinity, was it decreed&mdash;That
the wisdom of the Son of God should, as was
fitting, overcome the cunning of the devil; that the devil
should truly lose his dominion over men when the
Divine Wisdom was led to death in the human personality
of one who was not obliged to die; and that
the same person who in the Holy Trinity is eternally
the Son should become the Son of Man.</p>

<p>"And that you may in a manner understand this also,
how the Son of God Himself in His own personality
received the human nature, and not the Father nor the
Holy Ghost&mdash;though the whole Trinity is one God, and
at the same time each person is a complete divinity&mdash;let
us consider the similar case of the sun. Not that it is
the same with it as with the Creator, but I say there is a
resemblance.</p>

<p>"The sun has also its Trinity&mdash;that is, the body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
sun, the light which proceeds from it, and also the heat
of the sun; but when the sun comes to us it gives us its
light and its heat. But the light alone takes (on itself)
that colour of the glass or the membrane or the cloud
through which it appears to us; but the sun itself and
the heat will not have this colour.</p>

<p>"Oh, wondrous power! oh, unfathomable wisdom!
oh, most delightful goodness, how charming it is to gaze
on you that have deigned to open our eyes! And does
it not beseem us to admire this: how in Christ in
this Unity are gathered together&mdash;and how properly and
how usefully for us&mdash;three things in their nature most
dissimilar, as it appears to our minds. But what is
impossible to God? Oh, there is something new,
greater, and eternal joined together in this Unity. The
spirit is new; that was created when the Son of God
accepted to become a man. The body is greater than it
was when long ago it was created for Adam; for from
that body the bodies of all men proceeded, and afterwards
the body of Christ, which He took from the pure
virginal blood of her whom He chose for Himself as a
mother. The Word of God, then, the Son of God the
Father, that is eternal. And all this met in the one
person of our Lord Christ. And in this strange act of
the entire Holy Trinity the threefold power of God was
shown. Firstly, because out of nothing He created
something. Secondly, because He made something new
out of something greater. Thirdly, because out of something
mortal He made something eternal, or, as I should
rather say, because out of something dead He made
something eternal."</p>

<p>&#352;titn&yacute;'s two works&mdash;his books <i>Of General Christian</i>
<i>Matters</i> and his <i>Religious Conversations</i>&mdash;give us all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
that is really valuable in his teaching, and the other
works are comparatively of slight interest. &#352;titn&yacute;'s
literary activity was, however, very great during his
whole life. It has already been mentioned that he
re-wrote the books <i>Of General Christian Matters</i> four
times, and the <i>Religious Conversations</i> twice. A third
work of considerable size, not yet printed, appeared in
1392, entitled <i>Speeches for Sundays and Fast-days</i>; and
to his death &#352;titn&yacute; continued to publish smaller writings,
partly original, partly translated from other writers. In
the last years of his life the mysticism, almost always
latent in the mind of a Bohemian, obtained preponderating
influence on the views of &#352;titn&yacute;. His latest work
is a translation of the visions of St. Bridget, a Swedish
saint belonging to the early part of the thirteenth century.
As a recent Bohemian critic has justly remarked,
the visions of St. Bridget exercised on &#352;titn&yacute;'s mind, in
his last years, an influence similar to that of the "prophetess,"
Christina Ponatovsk&aacute;, on Komensk&yacute;.</p>

<p>Waldhauser, Mili&#269;, &#352;titn&yacute;, and many minor writers on
theology, who do not require special notice, energetically
attacked the avarice and immorality of the clergy, and
loudly demanded Church reform. Yet they were careful
to avoid all attacks on the dogmas of the Roman Church,
and, indeed, looked to the Pope, as the head of that
Church, as to the person who would initiate Church
reform. Different from these views were those of
<span class="smcap">Matthew of Janov</span>, the last of the precursors of Hus
whom I shall mention. Matthew obviously writes under
the strong impression produced by the great schism in
the Western Church, which began in 1378, four years
after the death of Mili&#269;. &#352;titn&yacute;, indeed, lived on for
many years later, but age appears to have weakened his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
energy and his enthusiasm, and he has indeed, in the last
editions of his writings, considerably attenuated many
remarks contained in the earlier ones.</p>

<p>Great, on the other hand, was the influence of the
schism on the writings of Matthew of Janov. The idea
of his master, Mili&#269;, that the Pope should himself become
the originator of Church reform, appeared an absurdity
at a moment when two rival pontiffs were preparing to
organise, by the sale of indulgences, so-called "crusades"
against their opponents, whom they already attacked with
the ecclesiastic arm of excommunication and the foulest
personal abuse. The only remedy that appeared possible
to Matthew of Janov&mdash;undoubtedly one of the profoundest
thinkers of his age&mdash;was a reform of the Church in which
the individual churchman was to take the initiative, and
such a reform, he thought, could only consist in a return
to the ways of the primitive Church, as described to us
in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Matthew's life was lived and lives for us in his books.
Very few words will suffice to tell all that is known of the
circumstances of his outer life. The year of his birth is
uncertain, but we know that his father was Wenceslas of
Janov, a poor Bohemian knight, and that when very
young he proceeded to Prague to pursue his studies at
the university there. He here fell under the spell of the
eloquence of Mili&#269; of Kremsier, for whom he expresses
unlimited admiration, and whom in one of his writings
he describes as "the son and semblance of our Lord
Jesus Christ, possessing a distinct and visible resemblance
to His apostles." Matthew left Prague some time before
the death of Mili&#269;, and pursued his studies at Paris for
six years, obtaining there the degree of "Magister". He
thence became known as "Magister Parisiensis," by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
which name he is generally described by contemporary
writers. After spending some time at Rome and
N&uuml;remberg he returned to Prague, and in 1381 became
a canon of the Cathedral of St. Vitus on the Hrad&#269;any
at Prague.</p>

<p>In distinction from both Waldhauser and Mili&#269;, Matthew
obtained no special reputation as a preacher, but principally
devoted his time to the composition of theological
works. Some of these works attracted the attention of
his superiors, and were condemned in 1388 by a Synod
of the Archdiocese of Prague. Matthew was obliged to
sign a document, which has been preserved to us by
Palack&yacute;, in which he withdrew a considerable number
of opinions contained in his works. In this recantation
Matthew withdraws his former statements concerning
images of Christ and the saints, which, indeed, he
promises henceforth to "adore and venerate." He
further affirms "that the saints in heaven, and their
bodies and bones, and also other sanctified things, such
as the garments of Christ, of the blessed Virgin, and of
the saints, ought to be venerated here on earth." In the
last paragraph of the recantation Matthew admits that
people, specially laymen, should not be advised to receive
communion daily. It is curious that Matthew's
far-reaching theories concerning the return to primitive
Christianity are not even alluded to in this recantation.
As the chronology of the works of Janov&mdash;of which no
single complete MS. has been preserved&mdash;is very uncertain,
it is impossible to decide whether he had not
then expressed these views, or whether it was thought
advisable to leave them unnoticed.</p>

<p>Matthew's sentence, no doubt in consequence of his
recantation, was a very mild one; he was suspended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
from exercising his functions as a priest, except in his
own parish church, during half a year. Janov died in
the prime of his life in 1393, and retained his canonry up
to that time.</p>

<p>There is sufficient proof that Matthew of Janov was
a very voluminous writer, but his works have reached
us in a very incomplete state, and they were entirely
unknown before the present century. It is not difficult
to account for the almost complete oblivion into which
these important works had fallen. Though the teaching
of Matthew was on many points similar to that of
the Hussites, yet no reverence for his person and his
memory was felt by them. They could not refrain
from contrasting his recantation with the very different
behaviour of Hus under similar circumstances. If
some of his works have been preserved through the
agency of the party that favoured Church reform, this
was because such writings were attributed to Wycliffe or
Hus. The adherents of the Church of Rome were, of
course, anxious that, after his recantation, the former
heretic theories of Matthew should, as far as possible, be
buried in oblivion. They, not without reason, regarded
some of the opinions of Matthew as most dangerous for
their Church. The celebrated Protestant divine Neander,
who perhaps has studied the works of Janov with more
care than any one else, declares that a thorough study
of Janov's works proves that, independently of Wycliffe,
there existed in Bohemia at the end of the fourteenth
century a strong reaction against the Roman hierarchy,
founded on principles somewhat similar to those of the
later German reformers. In his <i>Kirchengeschichte</i>, also,
Neander has expressed the opinion that the views of
Hus not only did not go farther than those of Matthew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of Janov, but that they indeed remained somewhat behind
those of the earlier divine.</p>

<p>It is certain that some of Janov's writings were in
Bohemian, as a decree of the archiepiscopal vicariat
(dating from the year 1392) has been preserved in
which Matthew was ordered to submit for inspection
two Bohemian books which he had just written. All
trace of both these books has long been lost. There is,
however, no doubt that the majority of Janov's books
were written in Latin. Those that have been preserved
consist of a large number of religious pamphlets, written
at different periods. Towards the end of his life Matthew
collected these writings and published them in a large
book entitled <i>Regul&aelig; Veteris et Novi Testamenti</i>. The
work is divided into three books consisting of chapters,
some of which retain the designation under which they
had formerly appeared as separate pamphlets. No
complete MS. of the <i>Regul&aelig; Veteris et Novi Testamenti</i>
is in existence, but it would be quite possible to reconstruct
the work from the different MSS. and publish it;
there seems, however, to be at present little probability
that any one will undertake this task.</p>

<p>No work of Matthew of Janov has up to now been
printed except the pamphlet <i>De abominatione in loco sacro</i>,
which forms the last chapter of the third book of the
<i>Regul&aelig;</i>. This treatise was formerly attributed both to
Wycliffe and to Hus, and it is printed in the large edition
of the works of the latter writer that was published at
N&uuml;remberg in the sixteenth century. Palack&yacute; has conjectured
that several smaller pamphlets included in this
large edition of the works of Hus really belong to Matthew
of Janov. It is indeed only recently that Palack&yacute;, Dr.
Lechler, and Mr. Wratislaw have attracted attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the work of Janov, and have quoted extensively from
the MS. copies. I shall attempt to give some idea of
his most characteristic theories by quoting a few short
passages from his works. Matthew's special love and
veneration for the Bible appears very clearly in a passage
contained in the introduction to the <i>Regul&aelig;</i>. "I have
in these my writings," he tells us, "principally used the
Bible, and but little the sayings of the learned doctors;
both because the Bible occurs to me promptly and
copiously, whatever matter I may be considering or
writing on, also because through it and through its
divine truths, which are clear and manifest in themselves,
all opinions are more solidly confirmed, more
stably founded, and meditated on more usefully; then
also because it is the Bible that I have loved since my
youth, and called my friend and bride&mdash;truly the mother
of beauteous affection and knowledge and fear and holy
hope.... And here I confess that the Bible has never
been severed from me, from youth to age, and even
to decline, neither on the road nor in my house, nor
when I was busy, nor when I enjoyed leisure."</p>

<p>A short quotation referring to the schism, which then
attracted the entire interest of all lands belonging to
the Western Church, clearly shows Matthew's views on
this subject. He writes: "This schism has not arisen
because they loved Jesus Christ and His Church, but
rather because they (<i>i.e.</i> the priests) loved themselves
and this world." Of the reform of the Church Matthew
writes: "It therefore appears to me that it is necessary,
for the purpose of re-establishing peace and union in
the Christian community, to eradicate all weeds, to condense
the Word of God on earth again, and bring back
Jesus Christ's Church to its original, salutary, and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>densed
condition, retaining but few regulations, and
those only that date from the time of the Apostles."
Later on, writing on the same subject, Matthew says:
"All the (above-mentioned) works of men, ceremonies
and traditions shall be totally destroyed and will cease,
while our Lord Jesus shall alone be exalted, and His
Word alone shall remain in all eternity; and the time
is near when these things shall be abolished."</p>

HUS</h2>


<p>The life and death of Hus and the principal events of
his career form perhaps the one incident in the annals
of Bohemia that is familiar to most English readers. I
therefore give but a summary account of the career of
the great Bohemian, for here, as everywhere, the need
of compression confronts me. I feel the more justified
in omitting many interesting incidents, as English literature
in the late Mr. Wratislaw's <i>John Hus</i> possesses a
short but trustworthy biography of Hus founded on
lately-discovered documents. The work is superior to
any other on the same subject. Even in Bohemian
literature no equally trustworthy biography of Hus has
as yet appeared.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The sympathies of Mr. Wratislaw are
indeed very evident, but he has never attempted to slur
over or to attenuate the arguments of the adversaries
of Hus.</p>

<p>The study of the life and of the writings of Hus has
until recently been greatly neglected in Bohemia, and
even now no complete modern edition of his works
exists. A recent editor of a selection from Hus's letters
scarcely exaggerates when he writes: "Two wrongs have
been committed on Magister John Hus&mdash;one was committed
when at Constance long ago his life was violently
brought to an end; the other consists in the neglect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>with which his works are treated at present by the
national (<i>i.e.</i> Bohemian) public."</p>

<p>John of Husinec, or <span class="smcap">John Hus</span> as he is usually called,
was, according to ancient tradition, born on 6th July
1369; neither day nor year of his birth are, however,
absolutely certain.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Many tales told of the early days
of Hus are taken from the records of the Bohemian
brethren, written many years after his death. From
the year 1400 onward authentic accounts of the events
of the life of the Bohemian reformer exist, and from
the year 1409 to the time of his death we have a continuous
and detailed record of his life.</p>

<p>At a very early age Hus proceeded to Prague to pursue
at the university there the studies required for the purpose
of entering the Church. With his usual candour
and simplicity Hus himself tells us that he originally
decided to adopt the ecclesiastical career rather for the
purpose of gaining a living than through any special
vocation. It is, however, certain that during his years
of study he already led a pious and studious life. He
has indeed confessed<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> that before he was ordained "he
had been fond of playing chess, thus wasting time and
causing irritation" (to his partners). Such a confession,
written while he was preparing for his fatal journey to
Constance, proves indeed how little he had to confess,
and is a touching instance both of his extremely sensitive
conscience and of the profound humility so characteristic
of Hus.</p>

<p>In September 1393 Hus took the degree of bachelor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>of arts, in the following year that of bachelor in divinity,
and in 1396 that of master of arts. His reputation for
great learning seems to have spread very rapidly at the
university, for in 1401 we already find him dean of the
Faculty of Arts, and in the following year he became,
for the first time and at an unusually early age, rector
of the university of Prague. He seems soon to have
attracted attention by his great learning, and by the
acumen which he displayed in the learned disputations
that formed so large a part of the routine of medi&aelig;val
universities. His learning was at that period noticed
rather than any special religious fervour. His lectures,
as Dr. Lechler has conjectured, were probably founded
on Wycliffe's philosophical works, which became known
to the Bohemians earlier than the theological works of
the English divine.</p>

<p>A change appears to have come over the mind of Hus
about the beginning of the fifteenth century. He has
himself told us that after his ordination as a priest (probably
in 1400) he led a yet simpler and more ascetic
life. The principal cause of the enthusiasm, both religious
and national, that henceforth distinguishes Hus
was, however, undoubtedly his appointment in 1402 as
rector and preacher at the Bethlehem Chapel in Prague.
The foundation of the Bethlehem Chapel, which took
place in 1391, and was the work of Kri&#382;, a tradesman of
Prague, and John of Milheim, one of the courtiers of
King Wenceslas, is an important manifestation of the
desire to reform the Roman Church and to enlarge the
sphere of the native language, which was then gaining
ground in Bohemia. In their deed of endowment the
founders stated that their object was the encouragement
of the preaching of biblical doctrines in the Bohemian
language. No special provision for the reading of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
masses was made, and no doubt many Bohemians, after
hearing mass in other churches where German sermons
were still preached, then proceeded to the Bethlehem
Chapel. The stress laid on the preaching of the Gospel,
one of the points to which the partisans of Church
reform attached great importance, proves that the
founders, or at least Milheim, sympathised with this
movement. The increased use of the Bohemian language
for preaching and its general development
greatly irritated the Germans in Bohemia, who believed
their preponderant position in the town and University
of Prague to be menaced. The Germans in Bohemia
were therefore thoroughgoing partisans of the Church
of Rome, rather from antagonism to their fellow-citizens
of Slav nationality than from any sympathy for the
abuses then prevailing in the Roman Church. This
division by nationalities, according to which the Bohemians
favoured Church reform, while the Germans defended
the authority of Rome, continued during the
whole period of the Hussite wars, and indeed far later.
It was only with the appearance of Luther that this
distinction entirely ceased.</p>

<p>The sermons of Hus at the Bethlehem Chapel immediately
attracted general attention. His great eloquence
is evident in the few sermons of Hus that have been
preserved, as well as in the fragments of them which he
undoubtedly afterwards introduced into his <i>Postilla</i>.
He seems to have preached on a wide range of subjects,
and by no means to have eschewed the topics
of the day. In one of Hus's earliest sermons<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> he refers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>to the invasion of Bohemia by the troops of the Margrave
of Meissen, the ally of Rupert, Elector-Palatine,
whom the enemies of King Wenceslas had elected King of
the Romans. It is easy to imagine the strong impression
which Hus's fiery words produced on his Bohemian
audience, which, though thoroughly aware of the many
faults of King Wenceslas, yet supported him against his
German rival. "The Bohemians," Hus said, "are more
wretched than dogs or snakes, for a dog defends the
couch on which he lies, and if another dog tries to drive
him away, he fights with him; and a snake does the
same. But us the Germans oppress, seizing all the
offices of state while we are silent. Bohemians in the
kingdom of Bohemia, according to all laws, indeed also
according to the law of God, and according to the
natural order of things, should be foremost in all the
offices of the Bohemian kingdom; thus the French are
so in the French kingdom, and the Germans in the
German lands. Therefore should a Bohemian rule his
own subordinates, and a German German (subordinates).
But of what use would it be that a Bohemian, not
knowing German, should become a priest or a bishop in
Germany? He certainly would be as useful as a dumb
dog who cannot bark is to a herd! And equally useless
to us Bohemians is a German; and knowing that this
is against God's law and the regulations, I declare it to
be illegal!" Though the date of this sermon is certain,
and its immediate motive consisted no doubt in the
cruelties that German troops were then committing in
Bohemia, yet it is evident that Hus already had in view
the preponderating influence which the Germans exercised
in the university and city of Prague.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that Hus was during the early days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of his priesthood on good terms with his ecclesiastical
superiors at Prague. This continued to be the case
even after discussions on the teaching of Wycliffe had
in 1403 begun to disturb the peace of the university.
At a meeting of the magisters which took place in May
of that year, and over which Walter Harasser, then
rector of the university, presided, the twenty-four articles
from Wycliffe's writings which the London Synod had
already declared either heretical or erroneous, were laid
before the assembly by John Kbel and Wenceslas of
Bechin, canons of the chapter of Prague, the archiepiscopal
seat then being vacant. Besides these twenty-four
articles, the representatives of the archbishopric brought
twenty-one other articles to the notice of the magisters,
which a German member of the university, one John
H&uuml;bner, had selected from Wycliffe's writings, and submitted
to the ecclesiastical authorities. The articles of
H&uuml;bner, as Hus truthfully declared, contained various
statements that cannot be found in Wycliffe's works.
"After these articles had been read out, and Magister
Walter Harasser, the rector, had carefully noted down
the votes of each and all the magisters present as representatives
of the university of Prague, it was decided by
a majority of the votes of the members of the university
that no one should dogmatise, preach, or assert, publicly
or privately, the articles which had been presented to
the lord rector by John, official of the archbishopric,
and Wenceslas, the archdeacon, under penalty of violating
his oath."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> A renewed discussion on the teaching of
Wycliffe took place somewhat later; this time, however,
the matter was only brought before the Bohemian
"nation", one of the four sections into which the university
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>of Prague was then divided. The condemnation of
the articles taken from Wycliffe's works was renewed
with a restriction&mdash;suggested by Hus&mdash;which stated that
no master or scholar of the Bohemian "nation" should
defend these articles in their false, erroneous, or heretical
sense.</p>

<p>Shortly after the first deliberation on Wycliffe's
articles, Zbyn&#283;k Zajic of Hasenburg was elected Archbishop
of Prague. A member of one of the most
ancient Bohemian families, Zbyn&#283;k had&mdash;though long
ordained a priest and for some time provost of the
town of M&eacute;lnik&mdash;devoted himself mainly to political
and military matters, as was then so frequently the
case with ecclesiastics of high descent. Though his
ignorance has been exaggerated, he certainly possessed
no profound knowledge of theology. He brought, however,
to his new office a strong feeling of indignation
against the immorality and dishonesty of the clergy of
his archdiocese, and had, at least at first, a firm determination
to remedy these evils by establishing a system
of severer discipline among his subordinates. It is a
striking proof of the great respect in which Hus was
then held, both because of his pure and honourable
life and because of his great learning, that the Archbishop's
attention was immediately directed to him.
"At the commencement of his rule," the Archbishop,
as Hus afterwards recalled to his memory, "ordered
him, whenever he noticed any irregularity contrary to
the rules of the Church, to bring such irregularity to
his (the Archbishop's) knowledge, either in person, or,
in case of absence, by means of a letter."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The Archbishop
gave a further proof of his confidence in Hus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>when he appointed him one of the preachers before
the synod of the diocese. These assemblies were held
by Archbishop Zbyn&#283;k more frequently than by his
predecessors; he no doubt thought that they would contribute
to the reformation of his clergy, which he had
so much at heart. Of the sermons preached before the
synod by Hus, only few have been preserved, but they
are sufficient to prove how mercilessly he censured the
immorality, avarice, and haughtiness of the Bohemian
clergy. These accusations, which were unfortunately
but too well founded, caused many to become enemies
of Hus, those in particular to whom Hus's words were
specially applicable.</p>

<p>The amicable relations that at first existed between
Hus and his Archbishop did not continue long. In
1408 the clergy of the city of Prague and of the archdiocese
forwarded to the Archbishop a written statement
complaining of Hus's preaching in the Bethlehem
chapel. In this document&mdash;printed by Palack&yacute;&mdash;it was
stated that Hus had, "in opposition to the decisions
of the Holy Church and to the opinions of the holy
fathers, and to the injury, shame, detriment, and scandal
of the whole clergy and the people generally," declared
heretics all those priests who received remuneration
for the administration of the sacraments or for other
ecclesiastical functions, whether such payment took
place before or after the ceremony. Hus was further
accused of having spoken strongly against the ecclesiastics
who held numerous benefices. Hus indeed wrote
an eloquent defence of his preaching, and certainly
succeeded in proving that Archbishop Ernest of Prague
had, when issuing an enactment against the avarice of
the clergy in 1364, used language almost identical with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
his own. Hus was none the less deprived of his office
of preacher before the synod.</p>

<p>It is important to note that this denunciation of Hus
in no way accused him of having preached anything
contrary to the dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church;
up to the year 1409, indeed, no such charge was ever
brought forward against him. For the present, the
priests of the diocese only stated that Hus had shown
extreme and imprudent zeal in his endeavours to reform
the clergy; such endeavours necessarily met with the
approbation of the worthier priests; the others could
not, at any rate, openly oppose them.</p>

<p>Relations with the Archbishop were yet further embittered
by a letter which Hus addressed to him in July
1408 in defence of Nicholas (or Abraham) Velenovic,
a priest who had been accused of preaching Wycliffe's
doctrine with regard to communion. As a Protestant
divine, Dr. Lechler has truly remarked, this letter reaches
the extreme limit of what is permissible to a priest when
writing to his ecclesiastical superiors. At the end of
his letter Hus addresses the Archbishop in these words:
"Therefore, most reverend father, open your eyes inwardly
and within, love the good, observe those who
are evil, do not let the ostentatious and avaricious flatter
you; rather let the humble and the friends of poverty
find favour with you; oblige the indolent to work; do
not hinder those who work steadfastly at the harvest
of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> It was inevitable that the form, if not
the contents, of this letter should cause offence. It is
indeed a characteristic of Hus, that while always speaking
of himself with extreme humility and almost exaggerating
his petty failings, he yet uses authoritative,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>not to say provocatory, language when he considers
himself as defining "God's law."</p>

<p>The definitive rupture between Hus and the Roman
Catholic Church, "the principal beginning of accusations
and grievances against me," as Hus himself wrote,
was brought on by events which had vast importance
for the whole Christian world. The schism in the
Western Church still continued, in spite of many efforts
to effect a reconciliation between the two rival groups
of cardinals and their respective leaders. France therefore
decided no longer to recognise as legitimate either
of the two claimants to the papal throne, Benedict XIII.
and Gregory XII., and to remain neutral up to the time
that a general meeting of the cardinals of both parties
should have chosen a new pontiff. Bohemia was one of
the countries that had hitherto recognised the "Roman
Pope," Gregory XII., but King Wenceslas, no doubt
honestly wishing to re-establish the unity of the Church,
decided to follow the example of the King of France.
He therefore brought the matter before Archbishop
Zbyn&#283;k, and also consulted the university of Prague.
The Archbishop immediately answered that he would
never forsake the allegiance of Pope Gregory. At the
university opinions differed. The Bohemian "nation",
of which Hus was now the recognised leader, was
strongly in favour of the king's proposition. The
Bavarian and Saxon "nations", as well as the Polish
one&mdash;which then consisted principally of Germans from
Silesia&mdash;took the opposite view. At a general meeting
held under the presidency of Henry of Baltenhagen,
a German who was then rector, it was decided that the
university should continue to recognise Gregory XII.
as the legitimate Pope. Hus energetically defended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the proposal that the university should declare to
remain neutral up to the time that a new and legitimate
Pope should have been chosen, and he thus incurred
the particular enmity of the Archbishop. At the end
of the year 1408 a decree was placarded in Bohemian
and Latin on the doors of the churches of Prague,
stating that Hus, "as a disobedient son of the holy
mother, the Church," was forbidden to exercise any
ecclesiastical functions. Hus addressed an eloquent
letter to the Archbishop defending his conduct, but it
made no impression on the mind of that ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>An important indirect result of the decision of the
university was that a fundamental change in its organisation
now took place. After the vote by which it had
been decided to ignore the king's wishes, and to refuse
to accept neutrality in the struggle between the two
Popes, both parties at the university sent deputations
to Kutna Hora (Kuttenberg), where Wenceslas and his
court were then residing. The representatives of the
Bohemian party, who were headed by Hus, no doubt
hoped for a favourable reception, as they alone had
maintained the views of the king with regard to the
papal schism. They were, however, mistaken. The
king received them very ungraciously, and even accused
Hus and other Bohemian magisters of being the cause
that Bohemia had acquired the evil reputation of being
a heretical country. On the other hand, the king was
most gracious to the German magisters, who had probably
come to apologise for their opposition to the
royal will, and he assured them that he would maintain
all their privileges.</p>

<p>A complete change in the views of the ever-vacillating
king took place in the following month. At that moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Nicholas of Lobkovic, a man of learning, and, it is said,
a friend of Hus, had obtained considerable influence
over Wenceslas. As "supreme notary", or director of
the Bohemian mines, Lobkovic resided at Kutna Hora,
then an important mining centre, and he was thus
thrown into constant contact with the king at this time.
Under his influence, Wenceslas, in January 1409, published
the "Decrees of Kutna Hora", which entirely
changed the constitution of the university of Prague. As
has already been mentioned, the university was divided
into four nations, three of which&mdash;perhaps contrary to the
intentions of Charles IV., the founder of the university&mdash;always
voted together, and were jointly known as the
German nation. The Bohemians were thus in their
own country permanently in a minority. A complete
change was effected by the decrees of Kutna Hora.
The king stated that, "whereas the German nation,
possessing no rights of citizenship in the kingdom of
Bohemia, has hitherto held three votes" (at the university),
"while the Bohemian nation, the lawful heiress of
that kingdom, possessed and enjoyed but one, we consider
it unjust and most improper that foreigners should
enjoy in abundance the profits" (<i>i.e.</i> benefices, foundations,
&amp;c.) "of the natives, who consider themselves
aggrieved by this deprivation, and we declare that the
Bohemian nation shall, ... according to the regulations
existing in favour of the French at the university of
Paris, and according to similar rules which exist in Lombardy
and Italy, possess in future three votes at all
councils, judgments, examinations, and other acts and
dispositions of the university."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Four days later a decree
of the king forbade all persons in Bohemia, both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>ecclesiastics and laymen, to continue their allegiance to
Pope Gregory.</p>

<p>All resistance to the king's will now ceased at the
university. In the year of the publication of the decrees
of Kutna Hora, all German professors and students, that
is to say, all those members of the university who supported
Pope Gregory, and were opposed to Church reform,
left Prague. The university now became a stronghold
of that party which was favourable to Church
reform, as well as to the national aspirations of the
Bohemian people. It was but natural that the reconstituted
university should choose John Hus, the leader
in the struggle, as its rector, though he had already held
that office a few years before.</p>

<p>The position of Hus was now more assured and more
prominent than at any previous period. His popularity
with the Bohemian people, who attributed to him the
change in the regulations of the university so favourable
to their nationality, was greater than ever, and they
flocked to his sermons in the Bethlehem chapel in even
greater numbers than before. King Wenceslas was grateful
to Hus for his aid in obtaining the neutrality of the
university during the schism in the Church, and his
consort, Queen Sophia, made no secret of her veneration
for the great preacher whose sermons at Bethlehem she
often attended. Archbishop Zbyn&#283;k, indeed, continued
inimical to Hus, but circumstances rendered it for the
moment difficult for him to harm the preacher at Bethlehem.
The Council of Pisa had deposed both claimants
to the papal throne, and had elected a new pontiff, who
took the name of Alexander V., and who was recognised
by the greatest part of Europe. The two previously
elected Popes did not renounce their claims, and still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
found followers. The Archbishop of Prague, who still
recognised Gregory, was therefore naturally without
influence on Pope Alexander. It was thus for the
moment fruitless that the Archbishop appointed an
"inquisitor" who was to inquire into the complaints
raised against Hus and his followers, and specially into
the right of Hus to continue preaching at the Bethlehem
chapel. Hus entirely ignored these proceedings, and
some of his followers even brought before Pope Alexander
a complaint against the conduct of the Archbishop,
stating that he had raised false accusations against them.
The matter went so far that Zbyn&#283;k was summoned to
appear before the new pontiff.</p>

<p>On September 2, 1409, Archbishop Zbyn&#283;k&mdash;inconsistently,
as Hus maintained&mdash;renounced the allegiance
of Pope Gregory, and recognised Alexander as the legitimate
pontiff. The reconciliation between the generally
recognised Pope and the Archbishop of Prague had a
marked influence on the destiny of Hus. The united
strength of the Roman Church is now directed against
him, and matters proceed much more rapidly. As early
as December 20, 1409, a decree of Pope Alexander stated
that, "through the action of the enemy of the human
race, recently in the city of Prague, the kingdom of
Bohemia, the marquisate of Moravia, and other provinces,
the false opinions&mdash;savouring of heresy and
division of the Church&mdash;once brought forward by the
condemned heresiarch, John Wycliffe, have been fully
circulated, particularly with regard to the sacrament of
the altar."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The letter continues to declare that in
future no sermons shall be preached except in "cathedrals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>collegiate churches, parish churches, and churches
belonging to monasteries." This was directly aimed
at Hus, whose Bethlehem chapel fell under none of the
categories mentioned above. The letter or decree ended
by instructing the Archbishop to appoint four doctors of
theology and two doctors of canon law, under whose
advice he was to proceed against those who spread the
heretical tenets referred to. The Archbishop was to
oblige all such persons to recant their erroneous
opinions, and to deliver up for destruction all MSS.
of the works of Wycliffe which they might possess.
Should they refuse to do this the Archbishop was not
only to deprive them of all benefices that might be
in their hands, but he was also to invoke the aid of the
"secular arm" against them.</p>

<p>The papal decree, for reasons that are not known,
only reached Prague in March of the following year,
and was made public on the 18th of that month. Hus
appealed to Pope Alexander, and again somewhat later
to his successor, John XXIII., but both appeals remained
without result. While awaiting the papal decision, Hus
had, in company with some of his adherents, delivered
up about two hundred volumes containing writings of
Wycliffe; they declared that if it were proved that
these writings contained matter contrary to the doctrine
of the Church, they were prepared publicly to
recant such errors.</p>

<p>Archbishop Zbyn&#283;k had, meanwhile, after consulting
the doctors of theology and canon law, issued a decree
forbidding all preaching except in the places specified
by the papal command; at the same time he ordered
that all the copies of Wycliffe's works that had been
made over to the ecclesiastical authorities should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
immediately burnt. It is probable that the decision of
the Archbishop, which he published at a meeting of the
synod of the archdiocese on June 16, was known before
that day. On the same day, the 16th of June, the
members of the university already protested against
the intended burning of Wycliffe's works. They maintained
that sufficient time had not elapsed since the
writings of Wycliffe had been delivered over, and that
it was impossible that a thorough examination of the
theological tenets contained in them should already
have taken place. They also stated that many of these
writings had no connection with questions of dogma,
but dealt with logic, philosophy, natural history, and
similar matters. However, neither Hus's appeal to
the Pope nor the declaration of the university, nor
the appeal to King Wenceslas, in which that learned
body begged that the burning of the books be at least
deferred, was of any avail. On July 16 two hundred
books containing writings of Wycliffe, some&mdash;as the contemporary
chronicler tells us&mdash;beautifully bound, were
solemnly burnt in the courtyard of the archiepiscopal
palace, in the presence of the Archbishop, the members
of the chapter, and many other priests. This measure
was followed two days later by the solemn sentence
of excommunication pronounced by the Archbishop
against Hus and his adherents.</p>

<p>The burning of Wycliffe's works met with almost
general disapproval in Prague. A chronicler, writing
probably shortly after these events, tells us: "Instantly
a great sedition and discord began. Some said that
many other books besides those of Wycliffe had been
burnt; therefore the people began to riot; the courtiers
of the king were incensed against the canons and priests;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
many opprobrious songs against the Archbishop were
sung in the streets."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The rioting in Prague became so serious, that Wenceslas,
who had been absent, returned hastily to his
capital, and while ordering that the owners of the books
of Wycliffe that had been burnt should be compensated,
he forbade, under penalty of death, the singing of opprobrious
songs, which had been one of the causes of the
riots. Hus and his adherents were still confident that
the Pope would, in consequence of their appeal, cancel
the decree of the Archbishop. In the meantime they
determined to defend publicly the orthodoxy of some
of Wycliffe's works which the Archbishop had condemned.
In the then usual manner a meeting of the
university was convoked, before which Hus, on July
28, defended the orthodoxy of Wycliffe's treatise, <i>De</i>
<i>increata, benedicta et venerabili Trinitate</i>. On the following
days some of his adherents, before the same forum,
defended other works of Wycliffe.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Hus also continued,
in spite of the Archbishop's prohibition, to preach at
the Bethlehem chapel, and his services were more
crowded than ever. When Hus read to his audience
a letter he had received from Richard Wyche,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> an
English adherent of Wycliffe, and in the name of the
Church of Christ in Bohemia saluted the Church of
Christ in England, more than ten thousand people are
stated to have been present at the sermon.</p>

<p>The papal see had meanwhile entirely identified itself
with Archbishop Zbyn&#283;k. Without entering into details
regarding the character of John XXIII.&mdash;it cannot be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>condemned more severely than was afterwards done by
the Council of Constance&mdash;it is not surprising that the
declared enemy of simony and of the corruption of the
clergy found little sympathy with him. Cardinal Colonna,
whom Pope John had authorised to give judgment on
the Bohemian affairs, rejected the appeal of Hus and
his followers to the papal court. That court at the
same time expressed its entire approval of the conduct
of the Archbishop, and enjoined on him to take immediate
proceedings against Hus with the aid of the "secular
arm". At the same time sentence of excommunication
was passed on Hus, and the city of Prague was declared
to be under interdict.</p>

<p>Though such attempts were obviously hopeless, endeavours
were still made to mitigate the irritation of
the papal court against Hus. King Wenceslas and his
consort, as well as several of the most prominent
Bohemian nobles, addressed strong remonstrances to
Pope John and the Roman court, complaining of
what they considered his exaggerated severity against
Hus. Queen Sophia's letters were couched in very
energetic language. She wrote: "An order contrary
to Scripture, agitating the people and disturbing the
order of our kingdom, has been published on the
suggestion of those who are opposed to the preaching
of the gospel. In consequence of this the preaching
of the gospel has, except in monasteries and parish
churches, been prohibited by the Archbishop of Prague,
even in chapels that have been sanctioned by the
apostolic see, under penalty of excommunication.
Your Holiness well knows that the preaching of the
Word of God should not be confined to certain places,
but that, on the contrary, it should be allowed in hamlets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
streets, houses&mdash;in fact everywhere according to the
requirements of the people." The queen proceeds to
request the Pope to withdraw his prohibition, and ends
by stating: "We will not endure that the preaching of
the Word of the Lord in our castles and cities should
suffer such hindrance."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> This interesting letter was
undoubtedly written specially in the interest of the
Bethlehem chapel, at which the queen was one of the
most assiduous worshippers. These letters remained
without result, and negotiations which took place on the
initiative of King Wenceslas were also fruitless, though
the Archbishop in the last months of his life seems to
have been himself in favour of a compromise. A court
of arbitration, composed principally of Bohemian nobles,
met by wish of the king, but the desired reconciliation
between Hus and the Archbishop was soon found to be
impossible.</p>

<p>Archbishop Zbyn&#283;k died in September 1411, and was
in the following month succeeded by Albert of Uni&#269;ov,
a Moravian who had formerly been court physician to
King Wenceslas. Uni&#269;ov is described to us as a man
of conciliatory character, and this appears all the more
probable from the fact that he was in great favour with
King Wenceslas. The king had always wished that the
Bohemians should settle their differences among themselves,
and as far as possible without foreign intervention.
This had indeed been the basis on which the recent
negotiations had been conducted.</p>

<p>But neither the Archbishop nor any one else could at
this moment have arrested the march of events that
were rapidly approaching a crisis. A comparatively unimportant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>event dispelled the last hopes of those who
still hoped for an agreement.</p>

<p>King Ladislas of Naples still recognised Gregory XII.
as Pope, and had therefore incurred the bitter enmity
of Pope John XXIII. The latter decided on undertaking
a crusade against the King of Naples, and caused
a decree to be read in all churches promising all
those who should contribute to the expenses of the intended
expedition the same remission of sins that had
been formerly granted to those who fought against the
infidels in Palestine.</p>

<p>In May 1412, Wenceslas Tiem, Dean of Passau, arrived
at Prague, and immediately began to collect money
for the intended crusade. This caused great irritation
among the population of Prague, then almost entirely
favourable to Hus and his doctrines. Hus and his followers
had already previously frequently denounced the
system of indulgences, and they now renewed their
attacks with increased vigour. A very stormy meeting
of the members of the university took place on June 7,
though the theological faculty had forbidden all bachelors
of theology to attack the papal decree. Hus in an
eloquent speech sharply attacked the practice of granting
indulgences in the manner then usual at Rome. Of the
contents of this speech we can form a certain judgment
from a pamphlet on the same subject which Hus
published about this time and which has been preserved.
He emphatically maintained that priests had the right
of remitting sins to those only who showed signs of
repentance and penitence, but not merely on receipt of
a sum of money. Hus's teaching was here very similar
to that of Wycliffe, and his opposition to the crusade
against the King of Naples recalls that of Wycliffe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
against the Flemish crusade of Henry Spencer, Bishop
of Norwich.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Theological Faculty of Prague again
condemned as heretical the forty-five articles drawn
from Wycliffe's works, now adding six more which were
attributed to Hus; it was stated that they had been extracted
from his speech against indulgences (on June 7)
and from his pamphlet on the same subject. About the
same time a considerable portion of the clergy of Prague
forwarded to Pope John a written complaint against Hus.
The author was a German, one Michael of Deutschbrod,
also known as Michael de Causis, one of the most steadfast
opponents of Hus and of Church reform. In this
document Hus was accused of railing (<i>oblatrare</i>) against
the clergy and against the papal indulgences, and also
of having "by means of his writings spread his pestilential
opinions through various districts of the kingdom
of Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, and the marquisate of
Moravia."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The consequence of these denunciations
was a papal decree pronouncing the "aggravation" of
the excommunication of Hus which had already been
proclaimed by Cardinal Colonna in the previous year.
Several of the former adherents of Hus, such as Stanislas
of Znaym and Stephen Pale&#269;, now abandoned his
cause, and the latter afterwards became one of his most
dangerous opponents at the Council of Constance.</p>

<p>The greatest part of the population of Prague, however,
continued to be devoted to Hus, and the continued
preaching in favour of indulgences caused disturbances
in the city, particularly after three young men who had
interrupted these sermons had been decapitated. Further
rioting seemed certain, and it was probably the fear that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>his person might be made a pretext for disorders that
induced Hus willingly to accept King Wenceslas' suggestion
that he should leave Prague for a short time. The
king promised, during his absence, to endeavour to
reconcile him with the ecclesiastical authorities. After
publishing an "Appeal from the sentence of the Roman
pontiff to the supreme judge Jesus Christ,"<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Hus left
Prague at the end of the year 1412. He first retired
to Kozi Hr&aacute;dek, a castle belonging to one of his
adherents, John of Austi, situated near the spot where
the town of Tabor was soon to arise. Afterwards Hus
spent some time at the castle of Krakovec, which belonged
to Lord Henry of La&#382;an, one of the courtiers of King
Wenceslas, and a zealous adherent of Hus. In contradiction
to the papal prohibition, Hus continued to preach,
and large crowds assembled to listen to his sermons,
which he often preached in the fields. He also remained
in constant communication with his congregation at
Prague, to whom he paid two short visits during his
exile. He addressed to them several letters, which,
next to those written while in prison at Constance, are
the most valuable of all the letters of Hus that have been
preserved. He did not limit his literary activity to these
letters. Some of his most important works indeed now
appeared in rapid succession. His most important Latin
work, the treatise <i>De Ecclesia</i>, the principal cause of
his condemnation at Constance, was written about this
time. Of his Bohemian works the <i>V&yacute;klad</i> (Expositions)
had been finished in November 1412, before he left
Prague; but other important Bohemian works, such
as the one entitled <i>The Daughter</i> (<i>Dcerka</i>), <i>or of the</i>
<i>Knowledge of True Salvation</i>, and the treatise on "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>traffic in holy things" (<i>Svatokupectoi</i>) date from this
period of exile.</p>

<p>Wenceslas had meanwhile attempted to redeem his
promise to Hus. On the king's suggestion, a diocesan
synod met at Prague in 1413, which attempted to re-establish
unity among the Bohemian clergy. On this
attempt failing, Wenceslas appointed a committee consisting
of four ecclesiastics, who were to hear the views
both of Hus's representatives and of his opponents.
This attempt also failed, as was indeed inevitable, in
consequence of the total divergence of the opinions of
the disputants. Two of the opponents of Hus, Pale&#269;
and Stanislas of Znaym, even refused to appear before
the committee after its second meeting, and were therefore
banished from Bohemia by the indignant king, who
still entertained the hope of restoring religious unity in
his country.</p>

<p>It was, however, before a far larger forum that the
case between the enemies and the partisans of Church
reform was now to be brought. In consequence of the
intolerable condition of the Western Church, which,
since the Council of Pisa, possessed three rival pontiffs,
the demand was raised on all sides that a General Council
be summoned for the purpose of ending the schism.
The influence of Sigismund, king of the Romans and
king of Hungary, brother of Wenceslas of Bohemia,
finally induced the reluctant Pope, John XXIII., to consent
to the meeting of the Council; and it was decided
that its members should assemble at Constance on November
1, 1414. The assembly was, as already mentioned,
convoked for the purpose of ending the schism, but the
fact that the discord in the Church of Bohemia had now
become widely known in Europe naturally drew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
attention of the Council also to the views of Hus and
his adherents. King Sigismund suggested that Hus
should attend the Council, and there develop his views,
and at the same time vindicate the orthodoxy of the
Bohemian nation, on which he as well as his brother
Wenceslas laid great stress. Before Hus set out on his
journey, King Sigismund offered him a letter of safe-conduct,
which allowed him, according to the words of
Professor Tomek, "to come unmolested to Constance,
there have free audience, and return unharmed, should
he not submit to the authority of the Council." It is not
necessary to discuss here the various opinions as to the
exact meaning of the letter of safe-conduct; the statement
of Dr. Tomek, the greatest living authority with
regard to Hus, may be considered as decisive. That the
letter was not merely a guarantee that Hus should reach
Constance in safety, is proved by the fact that he only
received it after he had arrived there; still less can the
remarks of Hus himself, who in his letters before leaving
Bohemia expressed forebodings of coming doom, he used
as an argument to prove that the letter of safe-conduct
had little value. Hus was well aware that no official injunctions
could ensure him against possible violence on
the part of such fanatical enemies as Michael de Causis;
nor could the possibility that the thesis "that no faith
should be kept with heretics," might be used against him
escape the sagacity of Hus.</p>

<p>Such apprehensions did not induce Hus to waver even
for an instant in his decision to attend the Council; he
felt assured that, whatever might subsequently be his fate,
he would be allowed freely to expound his views before
the assembled Council. After having addressed a letter
of farewell to his pupil Martin, and another&mdash;one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
most precious that has been preserved&mdash;to his Bohemian
friends, Hus, on October 11, 1414, started from the
castle of Krakovec directly for Constance. In his company
were the Bohemian noblemen Wenceslas of Duba,
John of Chlum, and Henry of Lacenbok, who were instructed
to assure his safety during his journey. Among
Hus's companions also was Peter of Mladenovi&#269;, private
secretary to Lord John of Chlum, who left a
valuable record of Hus's last journey, his trial and
death. Hus and his companions arrived at Constance
on November 3, and he at first occupied lodgings in
the house of a widow named Fida; the house, situated
in the street now known as the Husgasse, near the
Schnetzthor, is still shown to travellers. Hus confined
himself to his room to avoid publicity, and also to prepare
the speech he intended to deliver before the Council.</p>

<p>He was not, however, allowed to remain at liberty
long. On the 28th of November he was arrested by
order of Pope John XXIII., and at first confined for a
few days under strict guard in the house of a canon of
Constance. Thence he was conducted to a monastery
of Dominican friars situated on an island in the Rhine,
and confined in a dark and gloomy dungeon in immediate
vicinity to a sewer. He remained here from
December 6 to March 24, 1415. Endeavours were made
to justify the arrestation of Hus by the totally unfounded
assertion that he had attempted to escape from Constance
in disguise. Even the writers most hostile to Hus now
admit that there was no truth in this rumour.</p>

<p>As might have been expected from the nature of his
prison, Hus became seriously ill, and was for some time
in danger of his life. His Bohemian friends had meanwhile
protested energetically against his imprisonment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
but their attempts to rescue him from his dungeon remained
without result. It was hoped that Sigismund,
who arrived at Constance on Christmas Day (1414),
would interfere in favour of Hus, but though he at first
expressed some indignation, this led to no consequences.
From the beginning of January of the following year,
Sigismund granted the Council full liberty of decision
with regard to Hus's fate. It is, indeed, more than probable
that during the last months of Hus's trial the king
was in favour of his execution, hoping that this event
would intimidate the Bohemians.</p>

<p>The Pope had meanwhile appointed a committee, consisting
of three bishops, for the purpose of undertaking
a preliminary examination of the teaching of Hus.
The commissioners examined numerous witnesses, all
of whom were ordered to take their oaths in the presence
of Hus. Thus, on one of the days when his
illness was at its worst, fifteen witnesses were consecutively
introduced into his prison. Hus demanded that
a legal adviser should be allowed him, but this was
refused him on the plea that it was illegal that any one
should afford aid to a heretic. It may be noted that
the condemnation of Hus had been decided on long
before his three days' trial in June 1415, perhaps even, as
some writers have conjectured, as early as in the previous
November, when he was arrested. As soon as
Hus had somewhat recovered, the act of accusation&mdash;mainly
the work of Pale&#269; and Michael de Causis&mdash;was
brought to his knowledge. The accusation, consisting
of forty-two articles, was principally founded on statements
contained in the Latin treatise <i>De Ecclesia</i>;
the last articles only dealt with statements extracted
from other works of Hus. According to Mladenovi&#269;,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the authors of the accusation "had chosen their quotations
from the treatise (<i>De Ecclesia</i>), falsely and unfairly
abbreviating some in the beginning, some in the
middle, and some at the end, and inventing matter that
was not contained in the book." Hus immediately published
his defence, proving that he had taken many of
the passages in his works that were attacked from the
writings of Augustine, Gregory the Great, Bishop Grosset&ecirc;te
of Lincoln, and other writers of unimpeached
orthodoxy; he also complained that the quotations
from his book were incorrect.</p>

<p>New material for accusations against Hus had been
meanwhile brought forward. After his departure from
Prague, one of his pupils (Magister Jacobellus of Mies<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>)
had defended the necessity of communion in the two
kinds, afterwards the distinctive doctrine of the Hussites.
The followers of Hus at Prague appealed to him, but he
confined himself to declaring in his letters that communion
in the two kinds was permissible. When, however,
the Council of Constance had, on June 15&mdash;after
the last day of Hus's trial and a few days before his
death&mdash;entirely forbidden communion in the two kinds
to laymen, Hus went somewhat farther. He declared
the prohibition of communion in the two kinds to be
in direct contradiction to the Gospel,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and advised those
among his friends who were uncertain with regard to
the new teaching of Jacobellus, no longer to oppose it,
as unity among the Bohemians was necessary in view
of the dangers that, as Hus foresaw, would shortly
menace the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>The Council of Constance had in March 1415 deposed
Pope John XXIII., and the authority of the commissioners
whom he had appointed to judge Hus ceased,
while the decree of imprisonment issued by the Pope
also became invalid. Sigismund, to whom the guardians
of Hus applied for orders, contented himself with handing
the prisoner over to the custody of the Bishop of
Constance, by whose order he was now imprisoned in
the castle of Gottlieben, not far from Constance. He
remained there from March 24 to June 5, and was
held in yet severer custody than in the Dominican convent.
His feet were fettered with chains, and at night
his hands were also fastened to the wall by a chain. All
intercourse with his friends was forbidden, and we have
therefore no letters from Hus written at Gottlieben,
while he had been allowed to write when in confinement
in the Dominican monastery.</p>

<p>Having passed judgment on the Pope, the Council
now devoted its attention to questions of dogma. On
May 5 the forty-five articles of Wycliffe, that have been
so often mentioned, were again condemned at a plenary
meeting of the Council. This may be said to have
decided the fate of Hus, for the identity of many opinions
advanced in his treatise <i>De Ecclesia</i> with Wycliffe's views
was known to all. No agreement whatever was, indeed,
possible between Hus and the members of the Council;
for while Hus maintained that he had been summoned
to the Council for the purpose of freely expounding his
views, the Council now held even more decidedly than
at first that their mission as far as Hus was concerned
was limited to hearing his recantation of all the opinions
that had rightly or wrongly been attributed to him, and
then deciding what punishment he should receive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>It is probably mainly due to the energetic remonstrances
of the Bohemian nobles who were present at
the Council that Hus was at least allowed to appear
before that assembly. His prison was again changed,
and he was now conducted to a Franciscan monastery
at Constance, where he spent the last weeks of his life.
On June 5 he appeared for the first time before the
Council. "When Hus attempted to speak he was interrupted,
and when he was silent the cry arose, 'He has
admitted his guilt.'"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> As Hus afterwards wrote: "They
almost all screamed at me, as did the Jews against
Christ.... Many exclaimed, 'He must be burnt;' among
them I heard the voice of Michael de Causis."</p>

<p>This meeting of the Council did not last long. The
more moderate prelates, no doubt, realised how injurious
to their own cause such violence was. At the second
and third hearing of Hus (on June 7 and 8) the proceedings
of the Council had a more orderly character. The
questions with regard to the heretical opinions contained
in the treatise <i>De Ecclesia</i> and to Hus's views on communion&mdash;on
which subject an English prelate declared
his doctrine was in conformity with that of the Church&mdash;were
again thoroughly discussed. The whole proceedings
can, however, scarcely be termed a trial, and the
conviction of the Bohemian reformer was a foregone
conclusion.</p>

<p>Four weeks, however, contrary to the expectations of
Hus, passed from the date of his last trial to the day of
his execution. Repeated attempts were made to induce
him to recant, and several members of the Council visited
him in prison for this purpose. On one occasion, as
Hus writes, "Michael de Causis, poor man, accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>the representatives of the Council, and while I was with
them, said to my guardians, 'By the grace of God we
shall soon burn this heretic, and I have spent many
florins for this purpose.' Be it known to you that in
writing this I do not desire vengeance of him; that I
leave to God. Indeed, I pray earnestly for him."</p>

<p>All attempts to obtain a recantation from Hus having
failed, there was now no reason for further delay. On
July 6, Hus was brought for the last time before the
Council. The various accusations against him, some
founded entirely on falsehoods, were then read out to
him, and he was informed of his sentence. It was decreed
that his books, both Latin and Bohemian, should
be destroyed, and Hus, as "a manifest heretic," delivered
to the secular authorities for punishment. After
the ignominious ceremonies of degradation and deconsecration
had been performed, Hus was immediately
handed over to the authorities of the free town of Constance
to receive the customary punishment of heresy.
The horrible form of death applied by Nero to the early
Christians, when his Palatine gardens were lighted with
live torches, had unhappily in the Christian world been
adopted as the recognised punishment of those whose
religious views differed from those held by the majority
of the community to which they belonged. Hus was
therefore immediately led forth to the stake by the soldiers
of the municipality of Constance.</p>

<p>The execution of Hus is an event of such world-wide
importance that it is not surprising that legends concerning
his last moment, founded on no contemporary
evidence, soon sprang up. Such are the words, "O
sancta simplicitas," attributed to Hus when he saw
an old woman collecting fagots for his stake, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
pretended prophecy of the advent of a successor
(Luther).</p>

<p>A short extract from the work of Mladenovi&#269;, which
contains a minute description of the last moments and
the death of Hus, may be of interest. Mladenovi&#269;
writes: "When he (Hus) had arrived at the place of
torture, he began on bent knees, with his arms extended
and his eyes lifted to heaven, to recite psalms with great
fervour, particularly 'Have mercy upon me, O God,' and
'In Thee, O Lord, do I put my trust.' He repeated
the verse 'Into Thine hand I commit my spirit,' and
it was noticed by those standing near that he prayed
joyfully and with a beautiful countenance. The place
of torture was among gardens in a certain field on
the road which leads from Constance to the castle of
Gottlieben. Some of the laymen who were present
said, 'We do not know what he has formerly said or
done, but we now see and hear that he prays and speaks
holy words.' ... Rising from his prayers by order of
the lictor (<i>i.e.</i> soldier or town official), he said with a
loud and intelligible voice, so that he could be heard by
his (followers), 'Lord Jesus Christ, I will bear patiently
and humbly this horrible, shameful, and cruel death for
the sake of Thy Gospel and of the preaching of Thy
Word.'... When a rusty chain was placed round his
neck, he said, smiling to the lictors, 'Our Lord Jesus
Christ, my Redeemer, was bound with a harder and
heavier chain, and I, a poor wretch, do not fear to be
bound with this chain for His sake.'... When the
lictors lighted the pile, the magister first sang with a
loud voice, 'Christ, Son of the living God, have mercy
on me,' and then again, 'Christ, Son of the living God,
have mercy on me.' When he began again, now singing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
'Who art born from the Virgin Mary,' the wind blew
the flames in his face, and still silently praying and
moving his lips and head he expired in the Lord. The
space of time when he had become silent, but still
moved before dying, was that required to recite rapidly
two or at the utmost three Paternosters."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The works of Hus, both Latin and Bohemian, are
very numerous, and in recent times they have again
attracted considerable notice. Still a complete modern
edition of the works of Hus has not yet appeared, and
the bibliography of the existent writings of the Bohemian
reformer&mdash;for many of his works have entirely perished&mdash;is
still very deficient. A complete edition of the existing
Latin works of Hus was published in N&uuml;remberg in
1558, but it omits several works that Hus is known to
have written, and includes works by Matthew of Janov
and others. The various Bohemian works were also
frequently printed both at N&uuml;remberg and in Bohemia
itself up to the beginning of the seventeenth century.
I shall first mention the Latin works of Hus, but devote
greater space to his Bohemian writings. This is not
only in accordance with the general plan of this book,
but also justified by the fact that the Latin writings of
Hus have less interest, and particularly less originality,
than those written in his own language. This applies
even to the great treatise <i>De Ecclesia</i>, which, however,
cannot be passed over, as it had so decisive an influence
on the fate of Hus.</p>

<p>The earliest Latin works of Hus are in complete conformity
with the teaching of the Roman Church. Such a
work is the treatise <i>De omni Sanguine Christi Glorificata</i>,
written during the time when Hus enjoyed the favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
of the Archbishop, and probably by his order. Hus had
been sent with two other priests to investigate so-called
miracles which, as was stated, had been performed by a
relic containing the blood of Christ, which was exhibited
at Wilsnack, a small town on the Elbe. In his treatise
Hus asserted that it was impossible that the blood of Jesus
Christ should be materially contained in any one spot.
It was, he said, only to be found in Holy Communion.</p>

<p>Somewhat later&mdash;about the year 1410&mdash;the tone of
Hus's writings changes. He no longer writes as an
unconditional adherent of the Church of Rome, and
the influence of Wycliffe's ideas gradually becomes evident.
Hus's writings, still mainly Latin, are numerous
at this period; they deal with then current theological
controversies, and it would be of little interest to enumerate
their titles. One of these treatises, addressed to a
countryman of Wycliffe, entitled <i>De Libris H&aelig;reticorum</i>
<i>Legendis; Replica contra Anglicum Joannem Stokes</i>, deals
almost entirely with Wycliffe's doctrine. John Stokes,
a licentiate of law, was a member of an English embassy
which was sent to Bohemia by King Henry IV. It was
rumoured at Prague that Stokes had during his stay
there stated that Wycliffe was in England considered
a heretic. Hus immediately challenged the Englishman
to a public disputation before the university in the then
customary manner. On the refusal of Stokes to attend
the meeting, Hus yet delivered his speech in defence of
Wycliffe before the university, and afterwards founded
his pamphlet principally on the contents of the speech.
Many of the minor Latin writings of Hus are indeed
based on speeches delivered before the university, and
even in his larger Bohemian writings he has often introduced
large portions of his sermons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Hus's Latin works, as already mentioned, the
treatise <i>De Ecclesia</i> requires particular notice. The
work, written when Hus was exiled from Prague, and
probably finished in the year 1413, is to a great extent
a transcript of Wycliffe's work on the same subject,
and has therefore little literary interest. But neither
the events of the life of Hus nor the ideas expounded
in his Bohemian works are intelligible without some
knowledge of the treatise <i>De Ecclesia</i>. The Roman
Catholic hierarchy, far more powerful and far less
dependent on public opinion in the fifteenth century
than in the present day, could not but see that&mdash;independently
of all dogmatic differences of opinion&mdash;the
acceptation of views such as those contained in the
treatise <i>De Ecclesia</i> must necessarily produce a fundamental
change in the organisation of the Church.</p>

<p>The keynote of the treatise <i>De Ecclesia</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> is Hus's
peculiar doctrine with regard to predestination. He
divides all men into two classes, those who are&mdash;either
conditionally or unconditionally&mdash;predestined (<i>predestinati</i>)
to eternal bliss, and those who are "foreknown"
(<i>presciti</i>) to damnation. The mass of the <i>predestinati</i>
form the true Holy Catholic Church,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but the Church
as at present constituted includes the <i>presciti</i> as well
as the <i>predestinati</i>. Of the true Church, Christ is the
only Head. As man He is "Head of the Church
within it" (<i>caput intrinsecum</i>), as God He is "its Head
without it" (<i>caput extrinsecum</i>). Christ is the true
Roman Pontiff, the High Priest, and the Bishop of
Souls. The Apostles did not call themselves "Holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>Father" or "Head of the Church," but servant of God
and servant of the Church. A change came with the
"donation of Constantine" (that singular fiction which
played so large a part in the theological controversies
of the Middle Ages). Since that time the Pope has
considered himself as head (<i>capitaneus</i>) of the Church
and Christ's vicar upon earth. It is, however, according
to Hus, not certain that the Pope is Christ's successor in
this world. He is then only Christ's representative and
the successor of St. Peter, and the cardinals are only
then the successors of the Apostles when they follow
the examples of faith, modesty, and love which the
former gave. Many Popes and cardinals have not done
this, and, indeed, many saintly men who never were
Popes were truer successors of the Apostles than, for
instance, the present Pope (John XXIII.). St. Augustine
did more for the welfare of the Church than many
Popes, and studied its doctrines more profoundly than
any cardinal from the first to the last. If Pope and
cardinals give their attention to worldly affairs, if they
scandalise the faithful by their ambition and avarice,
then they are successors not of Christ, not of Peter,
not of the Apostles, but of Satan, of Antichrist, of Judas
Iscariot. Returning to his former point, it is not
certain, Hus continues, that the Pope is really the head
of the Church; he cannot even be sure that he is not
<i>prescitus</i>; and therefore no member of the true Church
at all. St. Peter erred even after he had been called
by Christ. Pope Leo was a heretic, and Pope Gregory
was but recently condemned by the Council of Pisa.
It is a popular fallacy to imagine that a Pope is necessary
to rule the Church. We must be thankful to God
that He gave us His only Son to rule over the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
and He would be able to direct it even if there were
no temporal Pope, or if a woman occupied the papal
throne.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> As with the Pope and the cardinals, so with
the prelates and the clergy generally. There is a double
clergy, that of Christ and that of Antichrist. The former
live according to the law of God, the latter seek only
worldly advantage. Not every priest is a saint, but every
saint is a priest. Faithful Christians are therefore great
in the Church of God, but worldly prelates are among
its lowest members, and may indeed, should they be
<i>presciti</i>, not be members of the Church at all.</p>

<p>The Latin letters of Hus will be mentioned later in
connection with those written in Bohemian.</p>

<p>Of greater literary interest than the Latin works of
Hus are those written in his own language. The latter
are written in a more independent and popular manner,
and it is on them that his value as a writer depends.
That Hus was a strong Bohemian patriot is, I hope,
evident even from this short sketch of his life. Almost his
first sermon referred to the oppression of his countrymen
by the Germans, and no one more energetically
aided the Bohemians in their endeavours to secure the
control over the national university. Yet Hus was by
no means a national fanatic or a hater of Germans, as
has been so often stated. It is sufficient to refer to
his often-quoted words: "If I knew a foreigner of any
country who loved God more and strove for the good
more than my own brother, I would love him more
than my brother. Therefore good English priests are
dearer to me than faint-hearted Bohemian ones, and
a good German is dearer to me than a bad brother."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Hus, like all Bohemian patriots, entertained a warm
affection for the national language. One of his earliest
writings deals with the correct spelling of the Bohemian
language, and the diacritical signs still used in Bohemian
are mainly an invention of Hus. He was also strongly
opposed to the introduction of foreign words into the
language, and refers to this subject frequently in his
"Exposition of the Ten Commandments." In that work
he sharply attacks the citizens of Prague who interspersed
their Bohemian speech with numerous German
words, and compares them to the "Jews who had
married wives of Ashdod, and whose children spoke
half in the speech of Ashdod."</p>

<p>Hus's merits as regards the development of his language
are also very great. That language had indeed
already, principally by &#352;titn&yacute;, been raised to a level that
rendered it available for the exposition of theological
and philosophical matters. But the style of Hus contrasts
favourably with that of his predecessors by its
greater facility and simplicity. This may partly be attributed
to the fact that Hus, particularly during the time
of his exile from Prague, associated much with the
humbler classes of the people, who, knowing no language
but their own, naturally spoke it very purely and without
interpolations from other languages. This spoken language
was adopted by Hus for his writings. He indeed
himself writes at the end of the <i>Postilla</i>, "That he who
will read (my writings) may understand my Bohemian,
let him know that I have written as I usually speak."</p>

<p>As already stated, the bibliography of Hus is as yet
very uncertain, and it is not easy to fix the exact dates of
his works. It may, however, be generally stated that
his earliest Bohemian writings were composed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
years from 1406 to 1410, that his most important works
in that language date from the last years of his life
(1412-1415), and that the period of his exile from Prague
was that of his greatest literary activity.</p>

<p>The earliest important Bohemian works of Hus are a
series of Expositions (<i>V&yacute;klad</i>) dealing consecutively of
Faith, the Ten Commandments, and the Lord's Prayer.
Each Exposition is followed by a shorter, more condensed
treatise dealing with the same subject as the
longer one that precedes. Of these Expositions the first
one, dealing of Faith, has most interest. It consists of a
continuous comment on the different articles of the
Apostle's creed. Hus writes: "We believe that the
twelve Apostles, immediately after Christ's ascension to
heaven, composed this creed. And as there were then
twelve Apostles, besides Paul and Barnabas, who were
called after the ascension of Jesus, thus, according to
general opinion, each article was expounded by one particular
Apostle. But be it known to you, that the learned
do not agree as to what particular article each Apostle
expounded." Hus then proceeds to attribute to each
Apostle the exposition and defence of one of the articles,
obviously following the method then usual at the theological
disputations at universities in which he so frequently
took part. In Chapter XVIII. the defence of the
tenth article, which refers to the Holy Catholic Church, is
attributed to St. Simon. It is interesting as containing
some of the very distinctive ideas of Hus. He writes:
"Every Christian must believe in the Holy Catholic
Church. The reason is, that every Christian must love
Christ, who is the husband of that Church, and that
Church is Christ's spouse.... And as no one will
honour his mother if he has no knowledge of her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
therefore it is very necessary to know the Holy Church
through faith, for ignorance of the Church causes many
errors among the people. Therefore be it known to
you that the first Bohemian who translated the Greek
word <i>ecclesia</i> misunderstood that word; therefore he
foolishly rendered it by the word 'church' or 'chapel,'
as if he believed that the bride of Christ was a church
made of stone or a chapel made of wood. But had he
translated the word <i>ecclesia</i> by 'congregation,' then so
many would not have erred. Others, again, err, saying
that the Pope is the Holy Church; others, that it is
the Cardinals with the Pope; while others, again, say
all priests together, and yet others (say) all Christians
together, constitute the Church.</p>

<p>"Therefore be it known to you that all men from
Adam to the last man form one congregation, which
God has divided into two; one division has been chosen
(for salvation) from eternity, the other from eternity has
been rejected, and it is known to God only which
(division) each man belongs to. The first division is
the universal community of saints, the second is the
universal community of the damned. There can be no
higher Church, according to God's will, than the first-named
(community). It contains all the good, and the
other all the evil, and yet these two (divisions) constitute
one community, one assembly, just as sheep and goats
form one herd, although the sheep are always in a way
divided from the goats, and these from them. Therefore
though <i>ecclesia</i> sometimes signifies a church of
wood or stone, sometimes the Pope with the Cardinals,
sometimes the priesthood generally, sometimes the whole
community of Christians&mdash;as the Church of Prague may
signify all Bohemians or a community only of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Christians&mdash;yet the Holy Catholic Church is the community
of all those who have been chosen; that Church
is called the bride of Christ, of whom it is written in the
verses of Solomon, 'I am His bride, He has adorned
me with a crown.'"</p>

<p>The other Expositions are inferior to the one just mentioned,
both as regards their interest and the style in
which they are written. The Exposition of the Ten Commandments
is in its teaching generally in conformity
with the Roman Church; only in occasional passages
are the opinions peculiar to Hus evident. After dealing
generally of the commandment "Thou shalt not kill,"
Hus discusses in a separate chapter its application to
members of the clergy. It must be remembered that
Hus's time was an age of warlike pontiffs and of
bishops who commanded armies. Incidentally this
chapter throws strong light on Hus's very elevated and
ideal view of the duties of the priestly order. It is to
this, no doubt, that his strong animadversions on the
behaviour of some members of that order (for which he
has been severely censured by hostile writers) should be
largely attributed. The Chapter (XLVIII.) begins thus:
"As in our times bishops and priests wage war, it is
good for us to know whether it is fit that they should
go to war and thus kill their fellow-creatures. It appears
fit to some, firstly, from this reason, that the priests of
the old law fought bravely according to God's commandment;
why then should not the priests of the new law
fight, who have to defend their faith as the others did,
and a much higher one? Secondly (you say), the Pope
goes to war, and gives the other bishops power to go to
war, and to speak against this is heresy; and who speaks
thus will become a heretic if he obstinately persists in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Thirdly, St. Peter the Apostle fought bodily, when on
Maundy Tuesday, being already a priest, he cut off the
ear of Malchus. The fourth reason is that the priests,
and specially the Pope, have two swords, the spiritual
and the temporal one; so also had the Apostles when
they said to Christ, 'Lord, behold here are two swords.
And He said unto them, It is enough.'<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The fifth reason
is this: many priests are strong, and that strength were
given them in vain, could they not use it for fighting;
why, therefore, should they not fight? The sixth reason
is: if bishops did not fight with temporal arms, the
Church would be in an evil state; for laymen would
lay hands on priests, rob them and beat them; who
would then wish to be a priest?</p>

<p>"But our Saviour Jesus, King and Bishop at the same
time, is the best mirror in which we should seek for
wisdom; for every action of His is a lesson for us, as
St. Augustine has said."</p>

<p>Hus then proceeds to refute the arguments enumerated
above, depending mainly on the example of Christ. The
passage, written with singular lucidity and penetration,
is unfortunately too long for quotation. Here, as
in many places, Hus speaks strongly of the pride and
arrogance of the clergy.</p>

<p>At the end of the chapter Hus addresses a warning to
the clergy. Should they persist in their pride, "you
will," he writes, "be judged and condemned, and your
prayer will be as a sin. Your days will be short, and
another will take your place. O priest, give up your
pride, be meek like Jesus, and you will be glorified
like He (was)! Suffer insult, robbery, abuse, blows. Be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>ready to die for Christ, and give up warfare, which is a
very uncertain path to salvation."</p>

<p>The treatise entitled <i>Dcerka</i> (Daughter), also known as
the treatise "on the true road to salvation," dates from
about the same time as the Expositions. It was
addressed to some pious ladies who lived in common in
a house near the Bethlehem chapel, and to whom Hus
also wrote a letter, which has been preserved. The
treatise has been called the Daughter, from the fact
that each of the ten chapters begins with the words,
"Listen, daughter, and see, and incline thine ear." In a
short preface Hus very clearly explains the purpose of
the book. He writes: "Listen, daughter, who hast promised
Christ (to retain) virginity. Listen, daughter, and
incline your ear, and know that I wish you to know
yourself, knowing in whose similitude you were created;
secondly (I wish) you to know your conscience; thirdly,
the wretchedness of this world; fourthly, the temptations
of our earthly existence; fifthly, the three enemies (the
body, the world, and the devil); the sixth point on
which I insist is that you should truly do penance; the
seventh, that you should value the dignity of your soul;
the eighth, that you should assiduously look to the
coming judgment; the ninth, that you should
value the eternal life; the tenth, that you should love
our Lord God more than anything." Hus then deals
with each of these points in one of the ten chapters of
the book.</p>

<p>Somewhat later than the Expositions, and the Daughter,
Hus published his celebrated treatise, <i>O Savtokupectv&iacute;</i>,
on "traffic in holy things," or simony, which he
completed on September 2, 1413. This valuable book
is written in a manner similar to that of the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
mentioned above, but the polemical tendency is here yet
more evident, for Hus is here treating of the great
plague-spot of his time. The constant note of just
indignation renders the book very striking, and it would&mdash;as
Mr. Wratislaw has truly remarked&mdash;well bear translation
as a whole. I shall, from want of space, be unable
to give more than one quotation. In Chapter IV. Hus
deals with the question, Can a Pope be guilty of simony?
He writes: "Let us see if it is possible for a Pope to be
a simoniac. Some say it is impossible, for he is the lord
of the whole world, who is entitled to take what he
wishes and do what he wishes. Therefore is he the
most holy father whom sin cannot touch? Now, you
must know that many Popes were heretics, and generally
bad, and they were deprived of the papal dignity.
Therefore be not in doubt that the Pope can be a
simoniac. And if some one maintain that he cannot
commit simony or any deadly sin, then he must desire
to raise him higher than St. Peter or the other Apostles.
And to the argument that he (the Pope) is the lord of
the whole world, who may take what he will and do
what he will, I will answer that there is but one Lord
of the whole world who cannot sin, and whose right
it is to rule and do as He will, and that Lord is the
Almighty God. And further, if, according to the argument,
it is said that the Pope is the most holy father,
whom sin cannot touch, I deny this; for one only is
our most Holy Father, the Lord God, whom sin cannot
touch."</p>

<p>After maintaining that it is possible for a Pope to be
a simoniac, Hus continues thus: "Let us see in what
manner he (the Pope) can be a simoniac. He can be so,
firstly, if he desires the papal dignity for the sake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
riches and of worldly advantage. No rank in Christendom,
indeed, is nearer to a fall. For if he (the Pope)
does not follow Christ and Peter in his way of life more
than others (do), then he should be called not a successor,
but an adversary of the Apostles. Therefore every
one who strives for this dignity for the advantage of his
person or for worldly honours is infected with simony.
The second manner of committing simony consists in
the various regulations which he (the Pope) issues for
his bodily advantage and contrary to God's law, perhaps
not openly, but they are regulations that may lead to
something contrary to God's law. And is it not contrary
to God's regulations that the Pope should decree that
his cooks, porters, equerries, footmen, should have first
claim on the most important benefices, even in lands
of which they do not know the language? And again,
that no one can announce anything (in church) if he
has not paid down money, and whatever similar arrangements
may be made. The third manner in which a
Pope can commit simony consists in appointing bishops
or rectors for the sake of money; and that case has
been made quite clear to us recently, when many thousands
of florins were paid down for the Archbishopric
of Prague."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>At the end of the same chapter Hus refers to the
question of indulgences, which from his time to that of
Martin Luther was ever before the Christian world. He
writes: "With regard to the giving indulgences for
money, St. Peter has sufficiently shown that they are
worthless when he refused to give for money to Simon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>the power to lay his hands on people, so that they might
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; no, the Apostles laid
their hands on the people, not for money, but gratuitously
for their salvation; obeying the words of their
Saviour, who said, 'Freely ye have received, freely give.'
And thus they worthily received the Holy Ghost, for the
Apostles were worthy bishops, and the people who truly
believed truly repented their sins."</p>

<p>The last of the great works of Hus, and also the
last one which I shall mention, is the <i>Postilla</i>, which
Hus finished about the month of September 1413. It
may be considered more popular in manner than his
other Bohemian works, and, written so shortly before
his death, it was long revered as the testament, or the
"last will," of the great Bohemian divine. The book
consists of expositions, or, as perhaps they should rather
be called, sermons, explaining the evangel of each Sunday
in the year. The Bible being then very scarce in
Bohemia, the text from the Bible which is referred to
precedes in every case the exposition or reading (&#268;teni&#279;),
as Hus himself worded it. The indignation against the
corruption of the Roman Church, which becomes more
accentuated in each successive work of Hus, finds here
its strongest expression. "The evil priests," he writes,
"do not tell the people that Christ said, 'If you do not
repent your sins you will all perish.' They have so
obscured the truth, which is Christ, that preachers
mention the Pope more than Christ, and they
praise and defend the institution of papacy more than
the law of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore are His
faithful sons oppressed in the lands; for in Bohemia,
in Moravia, in Meissen, in England, and elsewhere there
is much suffering, as I know. They murder, torture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and curse faithful priests, and it is useless to appeal to
Rome; there indeed is the summit of the wickedness of
Antichrist, that is, pride, lewdness, avarice, and simony;
thus has simony and avarice poured from Rome into
Bohemia."</p>

<p>Of more general interest than any other work of Hus
are the collections of his Latin and Bohemian letters,
and they are perhaps his only writings that will appeal
strongly to modern readers. They also, more clearly
than any other work, bring out the real individuality
of the great Bohemian reformer. His sincere and
unostentatious piety, his sometimes almost childlike
simplicity, his very touching humility, the warm friendship
of which he assures his friends, the unconditional
forgiveness which he extends to his enemies, all these
appear very clearly in these letters, in which Hus never
writes <i>ex cathedra</i>. I nowhere more regret that limited
space will oblige me to restrict my quotations. The
letters of Hus that have been preserved extend from
July 1408 to within a few days of his death. Those
written while in exile from Prague and those from
prison at Constance have the greatest value. Of the
earlier letters a Latin one, addressed to "Master Richard
the Englishman," dating from the year 1410, deserves
notice. Though it is usually stated that the
family name of Hus's correspondent was "Fitz," it
appears very probable that the person addressed was
Richard Wyche, a chaplain who was about this time
accused of being a Lollard, and who was&mdash;according
to Foxe&mdash;burnt for the same cause in 1439. Richard
Wyche had sent a letter to Hus and the Bohemians,
admonishing them to remain steadfast in the faith. In
his answer Hus writes: "Preaching before nearly ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
thousand people, I said, 'See, beloved brethren, what
interest in your salvation faithful preachers in foreign
countries take, they who are ready to shed out their
whole heart, if only they can preserve us in the law of
Christ,' and I added, 'Our most beloved brother Richard,
the associate of Master John Wycliffe in his evangelical
work, has written you such a comforting letter, that even
had I no other written assurance, I should be ready
to risk my life for Christ's Gospel, and I will do
so with the help of our Lord Jesus Christ!' The
faithful of Christ were so inflamed by this letter that
they begged me to translate it into the language of our
country.</p>

<p>"I do not know what further I should write to your
reverence. I am not able to instruct those who are
far more learned than I; by what words can one who
is weaker comfort those who are stronger soldiers of
Christ? What, then, shall I say? You have taken all
words of Christian instruction from my mouth. It
only remains for me to beg of you help by means
of prayer, and to render thanks for all the good
which, through your labours and by the help of Jesus
Christ, Bohemia has received from blessed (<i>benedicta</i>)
England."</p>

<p>Hus's letters from exile, as already mentioned, were
very numerous. During his absence the adherents of
the papal party endeavoured to suppress the religious
services in the Bethlehem Chapel, and some Germans
had even made an attempt to destroy the chapel. In
a Bohemian letter addressed to the citizens of Prague
Hus refers to this matter: "God be with you, dear
sirs and masters," he writes. "I beg of you firstly to
consider this matter before God, to whom great wrong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
is done; for they wish to suppress His holy word, to
destroy a chapel that is useful for [the teaching of] the
word of God, and thus to frustrate the salvation of the
people; secondly, consider the insult to your land, your
nation, or race. In the third place, only consider the
shame and wrong which undeservedly is done to yourselves.
Fourthly, consider and endure cheerfully that
the devil rages against you and Antichrist snarls at you,
for he will not harm you if you are lovers of God's
truth. Indeed he has raged against me for many years,
and yet I trust to God he has not harmed a hair on my
head; rather has my happiness and content increased."
The letter ends with these words: "Therefore, considering
these things, and placing truth and the praise
of God foremost and living worthily in charity, let us
resist the lie of Antichrist to the end; for we have with
us as a helper our Almighty Saviour, whom no one can
vanquish, and who will not desert us as long as we
do not desert Him; He will then give us the eternal
reward... I have written this down for you, as
I cannot well come to you, so that the priests who
endeavour to stop the religious services may not harm
your minds."</p>

<p>Many letters written by Hus at Constance have been
preserved; some date from the time when he was still
at liberty, others from the period when he was imprisoned
in the Dominican monastery, and afterwards
in that of the Franciscans. During his stay at Gottlieben
he was, as already mentioned, entirely prohibited
from writing. In the first of the letters written from the
dungeon in the Dominican monastery addressed to the
citizens of Prague, and dated January 19, 1415, Hus
refers to the severe illness which had befallen him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
consequence of the unhealthy condition of his prison.
The letter, which is written in Bohemian, begins thus:
"May the Lord God be with you that you may persevere
in your resistance to evil, to the devil, to the world,
and to the flesh.</p>

<p>"Beloved brethren, I write to you while sitting in
prison, but I am not ashamed, for I suffer hopefully for
the sake of the Lord God who has graciously visited me
with a severe illness and has again restored me to health,
and who has permitted that those should become my
bitter enemies to whom I have done much good and
whom I have sincerely loved.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> I beg of you to pray for
me to the Lord God, that He may deign to be with me;
for it is on Him and on your prayers that I rely to remain
unto death in His grace. If the Lord deigns now
to call me to Him, may His holy will be fulfilled; and
if He deigns to return me to you, then also be His holy
will fulfilled! Verily I am now much in want of help;
but I know that God will submit me to no misfortune or
temptation except such as are for my own and for your
benefit, so that having been tried and found steadfast
we may obtain a great reward... I have no one to
advise me except our merciful Lord Jesus, who said to
His faithful: I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which
all your adversaries shall not be able to resist. Dearly
beloved, remember that I have worked with you with
great devotion, and that I am anxious for your salvation
even now when I am in prison and suffering
grievous persecution."</p>

<p>Want of space obliges me to quote but from one other
letter of Hus, written in prison, though they all well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>deserve to be better known. This is the letter written
on June 10th, two days after his trial before the Council
had ended. Hus was then in expectation of immediate
death, though, as already stated, attempts were still made
to obtain his recantation, and his execution only took
place on July 6th. The letter, also written in Bohemian,
is addressed "To the whole Bohemian nation." Hus
writes: "Faithful in God, men and women, rich and
poor, I beg and entreat you to love the Lord God, praise
His word, hear it gladly, and live according to it. Cling,
I beg you, to the divine truth, which I have preached to
you according to God's law. I also beg that if any one
has heard either in my sermons or privately anything
contrary to God's truth, or if I have written anything
such&mdash;which, I trust to God, is not the case&mdash;he should
not retain it. I further beg, then, if any one has seen
levity in me in word or deed he should not retain it;
but let him pray to God for me that God may forgive
me. I beg you to love, praise, and honour those priests
who lead a moral life, those in particular who strive for
God's word. I beg you to beware of crafty people, particularly
of unworthy priests, of whom our Saviour has
said they are clothed like sheep, but are invariably greedy
wolves. I beg the nobles to treat the poor people kindly
and rule them justly. I beg the burghers to conduct
their business honestly. I beg the artisans to perform
their labours conscientiously. I beg the servants to
serve their master and mistress faithfully. I beg the
teachers to live honestly, to instruct their pupils carefully,
to love God above all; for the sake of His glory
and the good of the community, not from avarice and
worldly ambition should they teach. I beg the students
and other scholars to obey and follow their masters in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
everything that is good, and to study diligently for the
praise of God, for their own salvation, and for that of
others."</p>

<p>Hus then mentions by name the Bohemian and Polish
noblemen present at the Council who had afforded him
aid, and expresses his thanks to them. He then refers to
his sovereign, King Wenceslas, and more particularly to
Queen Sophia, who had always aided the cause of Hus,
as far as it had been in her power. He then continues:
"I write this while in fetters, expecting my sentence of
death to-morrow, full of hope in God, resolved not to
recede from the divine truth nor to recant errors which
false witnesses have invented and attributed to me.
How God has acted towards me, how He is with me
during all my troubles, that you will only know when,
by the grace of God, we shall meet again in heaven."
It is touching to notice that the imminent vicinity of
death by no means lessened Hus's interest in his beloved
Bethlehem Chapel. Towards the end of the letter from
which I have already quoted he writes: "I beg all of
you, particularly you men of Prague, to be careful of
Bethlehem as long as the Lord God will permit that
God's word be preached there. The devil has been
much incensed against that spot, and he has stirred up
parsons and canons against it, well knowing that that
spot is hostile to his kingdom. I trust in God that he
will graciously deign to preserve that spot, and that he
will obtain there greater advantages by means of others
than was possible through so feeble a person as I am."</p>

<p>From the time of Hus to the present day it has constantly
been attempted to define his doctrine, and to
trace the origin of the opinions that are peculiar to him.
According to one theory, the teaching of Hus did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
aim at a reform of the Church in the manner of the later
Church reformers, but was rather an endeavour to return
to the Eastern Church, from which Bohemia first received
the Christian doctrine. In the seventeenth century
Paul Stransky<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> wrote that even after the Latin rites
had been generally accepted in Bohemia, "humble people
and the populace, contented with the former religious
institutions of their land, tenaciously adhered to the rites
of the Greek Church." The same theory has in the
present century been maintained by Eugene Novikov,
Hilferding, and other Russian writers. The patient and
thorough investigation of this matter by modern Bohemian
historians, particularly by Palack&yacute;, Dr. Kalousek,
and Dr. Goll, has, however, proved to a certainty that all
reminiscences of the Eastern Church had in Bohemia
died out before the time of Hus.</p>

<p>It would be natural to attribute Hus's peculiar views
principally to the influence of the writers of his own
country who immediately preceded him and who have
been noticed in the last chapter. It is therefore surprising
to note that Mili&#269;, &#352;titn&yacute;, and Matthew of Janov
are scarcely noticed in the works of Hus that have been
preserved. It has, however, been conjectured that further
references to them may have been contained in the lost
works of Hus. In sharp contrast with this independence
of the writings of his countrymen is the strong influence
of Wycliffe on the ideas and writings of Hus, which
the recent publication of many of Wycliffe's works has
rendered yet more evident. It is certain that the works
of Hus, specially those written in Latin, contain lengthy
extracts from Wycliffe's writings, and that many of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>leading ideas of Hus can be traced to the same source.
This fact has been strongly brought forward by Professor
Loserth, who has quoted in parallel columns passages
from Hus's treatise, <i>De Ecclesia</i>, and passages from
Wycliffe's treatise of the same name, which are identical.
In a lesser degree Loserth has found this dependence
on Wycliffe also in other works of Hus. The German
professor, however, deals principally with the Latin
works of Hus, whereas his Bohemian writings&mdash;though
the influence of Wycliffe can here also be traced&mdash;are
far more independent and original. It must also be
remembered that in the fifteenth and even the sixteenth
century the modern ideas with regard to literary property
were unknown. Many writers, particularly on theology,
incorporated with their works whole pages from the
writings of their predecessors, and this without any
acknowledgment. It would also be incorrect to imagine
that Hus followed Wycliffe blindly. He indeed writes:
"I hold those true doctrines which Master John Wycliffe,
professor of holy theology, held, not because he said
these things, but because the Holy Scripture says them."
On the important question of transubstantiation Hus,
differing herein from Wycliffe, upheld the teaching of
the Church of Rome. It must further be considered
that in many cases ideas common to Hus and to the
English reformer can be traced far farther back. This
matter has been fully expounded by the recent foreign
and Bohemian writers on Hus. It will here be sufficient
briefly to state that the disapproval of the enormous
riches, of the arrogance and avarice of the higher
members of the Roman clergy&mdash;so constantly expressed
by Hus&mdash;can be traced back as far as to the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Emperor Frederick II. After Pope Innocent IV. had
pronounced the Emperor's deposition in 1245 at the
Council of Lyon, Frederick in a circular addressed to
all princes declared "that it had always been his intention
to reduce the ecclesiastics, particularly those
of highest rank, to that state and condition in which
they had been at the time of the primitive Church, that
is, leading an apostolical life and imitating the humility
of Christ."</p>

<p>In the following century Marsiglio of Padua in his
celebrated work, <i>Defensor Fidei</i>, wrote strongly against
the interference of the clergy in temporal matters. He
already maintained that the Church consisted of the
whole community of Christian men, be they ecclesiastics
or laymen. The Pope, according to Marsiglio, can claim
no right of supreme judgment in temporal matters, even
over the clergy, and the "power of the keys" does not entitle
him to place a man under civil disabilities by means
of excommunication. Somewhat later, in his <i>Dialogues</i>,
William of Ockham expressed similar opinions, though
he did not go as far as Marsiglio.</p>

<p>If we endeavour briefly to define the ideas of Hus as
far as they differ from the tenets of the Church of Rome&mdash;for
on most points he was entirely in accord with that
Church&mdash;we may state that his two leading ideas, closely
connected with one another, are his theory of "Christ's
law" and his conception of the "true Church." According
to Hus the law of Christ, or "God's law"&mdash;an
expression that afterwards became a watchword of
the Hussites&mdash;is contained in the writings of the Old
and New Testament, which contain all God's commands
to man. The second fundamental principle of Hus is
his conception of the true Church, which, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
him, consists of the totality of the elect. It is doubtful
whether this theory was in direct opposition to the
doctrine of the Church of Rome, in the development
which it had reached in the fifteenth century. Long
before his rupture with the Church, Hus, speaking before
the archiepiscopal synod, had defined the "Ecclesia"
as "Pr&aelig;destinatorum Universitas." The head of
this Church, according to Hus, is Christ, not the Pope,
whose predecessors held no higher rank than other
bishops.</p>

<p>It remains to cast a glance on the individuality and
character of Hus. He has always been judged in a most
opposite manner, according to the religious opinions of
those who wrote about him. As Schiller has said of
another very different, great Bohemian, it can be said
of Hus too:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Von der Parteien Gunst und Hass verwirrt</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Schwankt sein Characterbild in der Geschichte.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I must rely on what I have already written, but principally
on my extracts from the works of Hus, to bear
witness for the sincere piety, the enthusiasm for the law
of God, the patriotism, the humility and the sincerity of
Hus. That he was faultless, I do not attempt to prove,
and no one would have resented such an attempt more
than the great Bohemian, who, in one of his last letters,
begged those who might have heard that he had committed
some offence against God's law, not to follow his
example, but to pray God to forgive him. It is certain
that Hus was imprudent when, by high-coloured descriptions
of the misdeeds of their priests, he incensed the
ignorant and excitable population of Prague. Neither
can it be denied that&mdash;no doubt influenced by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
firm belief that he was speaking in the name of
Christ, not in his own&mdash;Hus sometimes showed traces
of the self-willed obstinacy which the enemies of
Bohemia have ever declared to be characteristic of its
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Such slight blemishes, visible indeed to the modern
writer, were not unnaturally ignored by the enthusiastic
followers of Hus. To them he was "The Martyr," and
the National Church of Bohemia, up to the time of its
suppression in the seventeenth century, continued to
celebrate the 6th of July, the anniversary of the death
of Hus.</p>

<p>If, neglecting for a moment the minuti&aelig; of medi&aelig;val
theological controversy, we consider as a martyr that
man who willingly sacrifices his individual life for what
he firmly believes to be the good of humanity at large,
who "takes the world's life on him and his own lays
down," then assuredly there is no truer martyr in the
world's annals than John of Husinec.</p>

<p>The name of Jerome of Prague was, particularly
among older writers, so closely connected with that of
Hus, that it would appear incorrect altogether to omit
mentioning his name. He had by no means the great
influence on the development of Hussitism in Bohemia&mdash;in
which country he appeared but occasionally and
for short periods&mdash;which was attributed to him before
the studies of the present century had rendered the past
history of Bohemia clearer. What influence he obtained
was through his eloquence, not through his pen,
so that his place in a history of Bohemian literature is
a very modest one. One letter still preserved has been,
on doubtful evidence, attributed to Jerome. It is more
pleasing, at any rate, to doubt its authenticity. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
supposed to have been written after he had recanted his
former opinions. In this letter (dated August 12, 1415),
addressed to Lord Lacek of Krav&aacute;&#345;, Jerome states that
"the dead man (<i>i.e.</i> Hus) wrote many false and hurtful
things."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />

THE PERIOD OF THE HUSSITE WARS</h2>


<p>The death, or, as his adherents considered it, the murder
of Hus was followed by prolonged bloody wars, during
which Bohemia, for a time, successfully repelled the
forces of a large part of Europe. Such a period was
naturally not fruitful of literary production. The writers
deal almost exclusively with theology, and are, with a few
very noteworthy exceptions, of secondary importance.
This applies specially to the very numerous theological
tracts or pamphlets, the names of which Jungmann has,
in his great History of Bohemian Literature, rescued
from oblivion.</p>

<p>The adherents of Hus divided into two parties very
shortly after the death of their great leader. The more
moderate party, which always endeavoured to obtain a
reconciliation with Rome, and some of the members
of which only differed from that Church in their views
as to the ceremony of communion, became known as
the Calixtines, or as the "Praguers," from the fact that
the town, and specially the university of Prague, was
their centre. The more advanced Hussites received the
name of Taborites, as the town of that name soon
became their stronghold. There were minor differences
of opinion in both camps. Some of the Calixtines or
Utraquists, as they were also called, were prepared to
accept the entire teaching of Rome if only the right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
receiving communion in the two kinds were granted to
them. Other Utraquists, who maintained that they alone
had preserved the teaching of Hus in its purity, differed
from the Church of Rome on other points also, as had
been the case with Hus himself.</p>

<p>Among the Taborites also a more moderate party,
led by Zi&#382;ka, and known after his death as the
"Orphans," disagreed with yet more advanced Church
reformers. Finally, it should be mentioned that the
intense religious excitement, and the widely spread belief
in the approaching millennium, led to the formation of
yet more advanced religious sects, against some of which
even the Taborites had no hesitation in employing the
"secular arm."</p>

<p>All these parties found exponents of their views, but
it will here be possible to mention only very few of the
very many theological controversialists of this time.
The principal champion of the moderate Utraquists was
Magister John of P&#345;ibram, who is stated to have been
a pupil of Matthew of Janov. His polemical works are
all directed against the Taborites, and even against the
more advanced members of his own party. His constant
adversary was the English Hussite, Peter Payne,
known to the Bohemians as "Magister Engli&#353;." P&#345;ibram
endeavoured, not very successfully, to prove that the
teaching of Hus was quite independent of that of "the
foreigner Wycliffe," and availed himself of the national
prejudices of the Bohemians for the purpose of alienating
them from the teaching of the English reformer and
his pupil, Peter Payne. The most important work of
P&#345;ibram bears the name <i>Of the great Torment of the Holy</i>
<i>Church</i>, and was long attributed to Mili&#269; of Kremsier.
One of his most noteworthy books also is his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span><i>Lives of the</i>
<i>Priests of Tabor</i>, written, like the first-mentioned book,
in Bohemian. P&#345;ibram here violently attacks Nicolas
of Pelh&#345;imov, the "false and monstrous bishop of the
Taborites," as he calls him. Other minor Bohemian
works of P&#345;ibram, as well as some written in Latin, have
been preserved. He died in 1448.</p>

<p>To the moderate faction of the Calixtine party belonged
also Peter of Mladenovi&#269;, who has already been mentioned
as one of the companions of Hus on his fatal
journey to Constance. He wrote a Latin work entitled
<i>Relatio de Magistri Joannis Hus causa</i>, which has been
edited by Palack&yacute;, and contains a full account of Hus's
journey to Constance, his imprisonment, and his death.
This work&mdash;from which I have quoted in the last chapter&mdash;was
very precious to the Hussites. Up to the time
of the suppression of the National Church of Bohemia
in the seventeenth century, it was customary in the
Utraquist Church services to read a portion of the narrative
of Mladenovi&#269; instead of the evangel on July 6,
the anniversary of the "martyrdom" of Hus. Mladenovi&#269;
also wrote a shorter Bohemian account of the
sufferings of Hus. He died in 1451 as administrator of
the consistory of the Utraquist Church.</p>

<p>Of the more advanced writers of the Calixtine or
Utraquist Church, Magister Jacobellus of Mies (or
St&#345;ibro) is the most prominent. He became, immediately
after the death of Hus, the leader of that party
which adhered most closely to his teaching. He had
already, during the captivity of his master, maintained
the necessity of communion in two kinds, a doctrine
which Hus had sanctioned in one of his letters.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Like
most Bohemian divines of his time, Jacobellus wrote a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>Latin <i>Postilla</i>, as well as numerous other polemical
treatises, both Latin and Bohemian. Some Bohemian
hymns written by him have also been preserved, Jacobellus
is, however, most worthy of notice as being the
principal author of the celebrated <i>Articles of Prague</i>,
that played so important a part in Bohemian history.
After this event we find little mention of Jacobellus, and
he died in retirement in 1429. Closely connected with
Jacobellus is his friend the Englishman, Peter Payne,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
whose name has already been mentioned. I have here
no space to sketch out his adventurous career. He was
obliged to fly from England, no doubt as being an
adherent of Wycliffe, and settled in Bohemia, obtaining,
in 1417, the degree of Master of Arts at the University
of Prague. He belonged, like Jacobellus, to the more
advanced Utraquists; and when the ideas of P&#345;ibram
gained ground in that Church, even joined the Taborites.
Peter Payne was also one of the Bohemian envoys at
the Council of Basel, where he was occasionally in
violent conflict with his countrymen, the English bishops.
Though living so long in Bohemia, Magister Engli&#353;
appears never to have thoroughly mastered the language
of the country. It is at least certain that when challenged
by Magister P&#345;ibram to a public theological
disputation in that language, Peter was obliged to
decline. Some religious treatises, written in Latin, in
which Payne defends the teaching of Wycliffe, have
been preserved. He appears toward the end of his life
to have cast his lot entirely with the men of Tabor, and
was still living in that town in 1452.</p>

<p>Among the members of the advanced Calixtine party,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>which was led by Jacobellus, and afterwards by Archbishop
Rokycan, we must mention Vav&#345;inec (Laurence)
of B&#345;ezova, who, though principally known as a historian,
was as devoted to theological studies as almost
all his contemporaries. His <i>Chronicon</i>, written in Latin,
is perhaps the most valuable contemporary record of
the Hussite wars. The book unfortunately ends abruptly
with the year 1421, perhaps in consequence of the death
of the author, of whom, however, little is known. The
Bohemian writings of B&#345;ezova are inferior in interest
to his Latin work. He wrote in his own language a
"book expounding dreams," at the request of King
Wenceslas IV., at whose court he probably held an
appointment, and a <i>Chronicle of the World</i>. He is also
the author of a Bohemian translation of the <i>Travels of</i>
<i>Sir John Mandeville</i>.</p>

<p>The leader of the more advanced Utraquists, after the
death of Jacobellus, was Magister John of Rokycan, the
first and last Calixtine Archbishop of Prague. The long
and eventful life of Rokycan&mdash;born in 1397, he died in
1471&mdash;belongs to Bohemian history. It will here be
sufficient to mention his writings. Rokycan was undoubtedly
a very voluminous writer, though probably
the great majority of his works have been destroyed.
Those still in existence are principally theological writings
of a controversial character. His most important
work is his <i>Postilla</i>, written in Bohemian, which strongly
recalls Hus's work of the same name, though, both as
regards profundity of thought and style, Rokycan's work
is far inferior to that of his master.</p>

<p>The priests and other members of the Taborite community
were probably not inferior in literary activity
to the adherents of the Utraquist Church. Unfortu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>nately,
after the battle of Lipan (in 1434), and the capture
of the city of Tabor by King Georg (in 1452), almost
all these works were destroyed. The customs and constitution
of that strange military-religious community,
that in many ways recalls the later Puritans, will therefore
probably never be exactly known. We gather
indeed some information from the writings of the
enemies of the Taborites, such as &AElig;n&aelig;as Sylvius.
His account of his visit to the city of Tabor is very
interesting. It appears particularly to have surprised
the Italian humanist how general in the town the
knowledge of the Bible was. "The Italian priests,"
he writes, "should be ashamed, they of whom it is
doubtful whether they have even once read the New
Testament; among the Taborites you would hardly
find a poor woman who could not answer any question
referring to the Old or to the New Testament." With
regard to the doctrines of the Taborites, we are also
obliged to rely mainly on the statements of their
enemies, particularly of Magister P&#345;ibram, who has
already been mentioned.</p>

<p>The leader of the Taborite party was Nicholas of
Pelh&#345;imov (Pilgram), surnamed "Biskupec," the only
bishop of the short-lived community of Tabor. Little
is known both of his life and of his writings. He was,
like most Bohemian divines of his time, engaged in
incessant theological controversies. Chel&#269;icky's <i>Reply</i>
<i>to Nicholas</i> has been preserved, but the letter of Nicholas
in answer to which it was written is no longer in existence;
a polemical work of Nicholas addressed to
Rokycan has also been lost. The principal work of
Biskupec, however, his Latin <i>Chronicon Continens causam</i>
<i>sacerdotum Taboriensium</i>, has been preserved, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
edited and published by Professor H&ouml;fler in the present
century. It is interesting as being the only existent
definition of the doctrines of the Taborites written by
a member of the community.</p>

<p>I follow the example of Jungmann and Jire&#269;ek, as
well as of the most recent writers on Bohemian literature,
in including among the writers of the Taborite
party the celebrated Bohemian warrior John Zi&#382;ka of
Trocnov, born about the year 1378. It has already
been mentioned that Zi&#382;ka was the head of the more
moderate division of the Taborists, which after his
death assumed the name of the "Orphans." Zi&#382;ka's
writings consist indeed only of the curious work entitled
<i>The Regulations of War</i> (&#344;&aacute;d vojensk&yacute;), four
letters, and a war-song or hymn, but they are among
the most precious relics in the Bohemian language.
They give a thorough insight into the real nature and
character of the hero of the Hussite wars, who has so
often been compared to Oliver Cromwell. The <i>&#344;&aacute;d vojensk&yacute;</i>
is no mere collection of military regulations;
besides establishing the rule of an iron discipline,
it also enforces religious practices, and repeatedly
proclaims&mdash;in a manner very unusual in the fifteenth
century&mdash;the absolute equality of the different classes
of men who composed the Hussite armies. It is
perhaps only after reading these regulations that the
victories of the Hussites over immensely superior forces
become intelligible.</p>

<p>Of Zi&#382;ka's letters, the most noteworthy is the celebrated
<i>Letter to the Allies of Doma&#382;lice</i>. The citizens of
Doma&#382;lice (Tauss) had been attacked by the Germans,
and applied to their Hussite comrades for aid. Zi&#382;ka
wrote to them: "Dear Brothers in God!&mdash;I beg you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
for the sake of the Lord God to remain in the fear of
God as His most beloved sons, and not to complain if
He chastises you. Remembering the founder of our
faith, our Lord Jesus Christ, you will defend yourselves
bravely against the wrongs which these Germans endeavour
to inflict on you. You will thus follow the
example of the ancient Bohemians, who, valiantly using
their lances, defended both God's cause and their own.
And we, dear brethren, seeking the law of God and the
good of the commonwealth, will do everything possible,
that every one of our men who is able to wield a club
or even to hurl a stone should march to your aid. And
therefore, dear brethren, be it known to you that we
are collecting our men from all parts of the country
against these enemies of God and devastators of the Bohemian
land. Therefore instruct your priests, that they may
when preaching rouse the people against the armies of
Antichrist. Let it also be proclaimed in the marketplace
that all able men, young or old, must be ready at
any moment. And we, God willing, shall be shortly
with you. Have bread, beer, fodder for the horses
ready, as well as all weapons of war. For indeed it is
time (to march), not only against the internal enemies,
but also against the foreigners. Remember your first
campaign, when you fought bravely, humble men
against the great, few against many, unclothed against
men in armour. For the arm of God has not been
shortened! Therefore trust in God and be ready.
May the Lord God grant you strength!"</p>

<p>Very similar to the <i>Regulations of War</i> and to the
letters of Zi&#382;ka are the sentiments contained in the
well-known Taborite war-song, <i>All ye Warriors of God</i>,
which has often been called the Bohemian <i>Marseillaise</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of the fifteenth century. Want of space obliges me to
quote only some of the first and the last lines of this
spirited song, which, according to the most recent researches,
is undoubtedly a work of Zi&#382;ka:&mdash;</p>

<p>The eventful life of Zi&#382;ka belongs to Bohemian history,
but it may yet not be out of place to mention here that
his life and career have constantly been systematically
misrepresented by writers hostile to his faith; and
particularly outside of Bohemia scarcely any other writings
referring to Zi&#382;ka were known. He thus passed
down from one generation of writers to another as a
ferocious and bloodthirsty robber and fanatic. The real
Zi&#382;ka was, as repeatedly mentioned, the leader of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
moderate Taborites, and the contemporary writers mention
several cases when Zi&#382;ka reproved the barbarity of
his soldiers. It is none the less impossible to acquit him
altogether from the accusation of cruelty, but it is certain
that his conduct in this respect was far more humane
than that of his adversaries, the so-called crusaders, who
several times invaded Bohemia and openly proclaimed
their intention "to let no heretic live." The account of
the death of Zi&#382;ka, according to which he died blaspheming,
and ordered that his body should be flayed, his skin
used as a drum, and his body thrown to the wild beasts&mdash;first
mentioned by &AElig;n&aelig;as Sylvius, and since repeated
by countless writers&mdash;is also totally devoid of truth. It
may be of interest to quote the account of Zi&#382;ka's death
given by one of the contemporary chroniclers.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It runs
thus: "Here (at P&#345;ibislav) brother Zi&#382;ka was seized by
a deadly attack of the plague. He gave his last charge
to his faithful Bohemians, (saying,) that, fearing their
beloved God, they should firmly and faithfully defend
God's law in view of His reward in eternity. And
then brother Zi&#382;ka recommended his soul to God, and
died on the Wednesday before the day of St. Gallus"
(October 11, 1424). Even had we no historical evidence
to the point, this tranquil death would appear a fitting
end for the great Bohemian general. He who had so
often fought what he firmly considered God's battle,
assuredly did not dread entering into God's peace.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that besides the two great
divisions of the Hussites, minor religious sects sprung
up in Bohemia in consequence of the general religious
exaltation which prevailed in the country, particularly
in the earlier part of the fifteenth century. These sects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>went far beyond the teaching of the Calixtines, and even
of the Taborites. They were frequently influenced by
chiliastic ideas, which not unnaturally lead to socialism.
Of such fanatics the one who attracted most attention
was the priest Martin Huska, also known under the
name of "Loquis." He obtained a considerable following
among the people of Bohemia, who called him "the
Lion of Daniel" and "the Angel of God's Legion." His
influence soon became prejudicial to the strict military
discipline which Zi&#382;ka maintained at Tabor. He was
arrested by order of that general, and, after he had
repeatedly broken his promise to discontinue his preaching,
was burnt on August 21, 1421. It is stated that Huska
was the author of numerous theological treatises, but
none of them have been preserved. The little we know
of his opinions is derived from the writings of P&#345;ibram,
who frequently quotes his works.</p>

<p>I shall next refer to one of the most independent and
original of Bohemian writers, <span class="smcap">Peter Chel&#269;icky</span>. Though
only recently well known in Bohemia, and still almost
unknown elsewhere, Chel&#269;icky is well worthy of a far
more extensive study than limited space will here permit
me to devote to him. Though a contemporary of the
theologians whom I have mentioned in this chapter, and
on terms of acquaintance with some of them, Chel&#269;icky
everywhere impresses us as an independent thinker.
As Professor Jagi&#269; has recently written in his Russian
preface to the Petersburg edition of the <i>Net of Faith</i>, it
is difficult to calculate how great would have been the
influence of Chel&#269;icky's works had they been written
in English, German, or French instead of in Bohemian.
Chel&#269;icky may be described as a socialist, but his socialism
was rather that of the primitive Church or of Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Tolstoy&mdash;to whom Chel&#269;icky has often been compared&mdash;than
that of the modern disturbers of public order.
Horror of bloodshed and of all violence is indeed one of
the distinctive tenets of Chel&#269;icky, and absolute obedience
to all, even the most unjust authorities, is enjoined by
him. Chel&#269;icky's ideal is the communism of the primitive
Church such as he imagined it. The source of
all evil is the "donation of Constantine."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> When the
Church was then for the first time enriched, an angel,
Chel&#269;icky tells us, spoke the words: "To-day has poison
been infused into the Church of Christ." This mystical
conception of the primitive Church is the foundation of
most of Chel&#269;icky's tenets. As the primitive Christians
had no part in the government of the Roman empire,
therefore no true Christian can hold any office of state.
He may, indeed must obey, but he should not command.
In the primitive Church, according to Chel&#269;icky,
all were equal. Therefore the "bands," that is, the temporal
and ecclesiastical grades and ranks among men, are
hateful "to the meek and poor Lord Jesus." In his
intense hatred of all temporal and spiritual authority,
Chel&#269;icky sometimes appears to expound very modern
ideas, but we must always remember that we are reading
the words of a writer of the fifteenth century and of a
fervent Christian.</p>

<p>Very characteristic of Chel&#269;icky is his hatred of bloodshed.
While the magisters of the Calixtine Church had,
after a prolonged discussion, decided that war in self-defence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>was permissible, and even a duty for those who
held the true doctrine, Chel&#269;icky maintained the absolute
sinfulness of war under whatever circumstances.
In his <i>Reply to Rokycan</i> he writes: "Has Christ repealed
His command&mdash;'Thou shall not kill'? If
Christ has not revoked that order, then it must still
be obeyed both at Prague and at Tabor." Chel&#269;icky
was, therefore, entirely out of sympathy with his
countrymen during the momentous period (from 1420
to 1434) when their great victories attracted the attention
of all Europe. It is a natural consequence that
even at a period of general national enthusiasm, Chel&#269;icky&mdash;similar
in this respect to the socialists of all
times&mdash;shows an almost complete absence of pride in
his distinctive nationality.</p>

<p>A result of Chel&#269;icky's intense hatred of all social
privileges and distinctions was his repeated quaint jibes
against the nobility and the clergy, and his pronounced
affection for the humble life of the peasantry, another of
the many traits in Chel&#269;icky in which he appears similar
to Tolstoy. Though the uncontested fact that he was
able to spend a considerable time at Prague at his own
expense proves that Chel&#269;icky was not entirely without
means, and it is probable that he was a small landowner,
yet he always speaks of himself as a peasant.
Thus, in his <i>Reply to Rokycan</i> he writes: "If, therefore,
I, the peasant, strike out blindly with my club, your
reverence must not be scandalised."</p>

<p>Chel&#269;icky has nowhere attempted to expound his
views on the constitution of Church and State systematically.
In the <i>S&iacute;t V&iacute;ry</i> ("Net of Faith "), undoubtedly
his masterpiece, we find the nearest approach to such
an attempt. The sum of his teaching&mdash;as I have written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
elsewhere&mdash;constitutes an attempt to establish a theory
of religious nihilism, substituting for all secular and
ecclesiastical authority the ill-defined "will of God."</p>

<p>The details of the life of Chel&#269;icky are still obscure,
though the recent researches of Bohemian writers,
specially of Professor Goll&mdash;to whose Bohemian and
German works I wish here to acknowledge my indebtedness&mdash;have
established a certain number of facts as
certain. It would perhaps be unnecessary again to
mention that the foolish tale that Chel&#269;icky was a cobbler
is devoid of truth, had not this statement found its way
into an English work dealing with Bohemia that has
appeared within the last few years. Peter Chel&#269;icky was
born at Chel&#269;ic near Vodnan, in Southern Bohemia,
towards the end of the fourteenth century, probably as
the son of a small landowner. He proceeded to Prague
early in life, and remained there for a considerable time
occupied with studies principally of a theological character.
It is, however, certain that he never took orders,
as was formerly supposed, and that he did not pursue
his studies at the university. He was indeed debarred
from doing so by insufficient knowledge of the Latin
language. As he has himself told us, he acquired but a
very slight knowledge of that language during his stay at
Prague. He had, however, read portions of the works
of Wycliffe, to whom he refers frequently, and who is
probably the "Magister Protiva" who is often quoted by
Chel&#269;icky.</p>

<p>He, however, as he himself tells us, acquired most
of his knowledge of the opinions of Wycliffe and
other theologians from his frequent conversations with
numerous Bohemian priests. It is specially recorded
that he had frequent intercourse with the priests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Bethlehem Chapel, that stronghold of the Bohemian
Church reformers. Neither the date of Chel&#269;icky's arrival
at Prague nor that of his departure is certain. It is very
probable that he was in that city during the last years
of the life of Hus, and a passage in one of his writings
renders it probable that he was personally acquainted
with the great Bohemian reformer. Chel&#269;icky was in
Prague during the stormy years 1419 and 1420, and the
terrible scenes that he then witnessed no doubt intensified
his horror of bloodshed. He probably left Prague
not long after the bloody battle of the Vy&#353;ehrad (November
1, 1420), and spent the rest of his life on his farm
at Chel&#269;ic. Though living in retirement, Chel&#269;icky continued
to take part in the numerous theological controversies
of his time, and it also appears that towards the
end of his life some of his followers formed a small
community known as the "Brothers of Chel&#269;ic," of
which he became the head. Chel&#269;icky died about the
year 1460.</p>

<p>There is sufficient contemporary evidence to prove
that Chel&#269;icky was a voluminous writer, but many of
his works have been lost, and up to the beginning of
the present century they had all fallen into almost complete
oblivion. The strongly democratic character of
these writings, and the bitter invectives against the aristocracy
and clergy which they contain, rendered them
specially obnoxious during the period of reaction that
followed the battle of the White Mountain. It is indeed
only within the last ten or twelve years that some of
Chel&#269;icky's works have been edited, and much further
work is required before we can thoroughly appreciate
his position in Bohemian literature.</p>

<p>We possess four larger works of Chel&#269;icky, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span><i>Reply to</i>
<i>Nicholas of Pelh&#345;imov</i>, the <i>Postilla</i>, the <i>Net of Faith</i>, and
the <i>Reply to Rokycan</i> which, according to Dr. Goll, than
whom there can be no higher authority on this subject,
were probably written in the order in which I have
enumerated them. Many minor works of Chel&#269;icky are
also still in existence, and may be considered as connected
with one of the larger works, some part of which
is in them treated in a more detailed manner. The <i>Net</i>
<i>of Faith</i> (<i>S&iacute;t V&iacute;ry</i>) is superior both as regards style and
lucidity to the rest of Chel&#269;icky's works, and I will
therefore devote to it more space than to the author's
other writings.</p>

<p>The <i>Reply to Nicholas</i> (of Pelh&#345;imov), bishop of
the Taborites, who has already been mentioned in this
work, is probably the first important writing of Chel&#269;icky,
and dates from about the year 1424. Peter has
himself told us how it came to be written. When
Bishop Nicholas was passing through Vodnan, he sent
a messenger to the neighbouring village of Chel&#269;ic inviting
the peasant-theologian to meet him. When Peter
arrived, he found the bishop sitting on the dyke of a
fishpond, and Nicholas asked him what the people
thought of their (<i>i.e.</i> the Taborites) doctrine with regard
to the sacrament of communion. Chel&#269;icky replied that
some approved of it, but others blamed it. The bishop
then said that their teaching was in accordance with
that of the Bible. This meeting was followed by several
others, and a correspondence between Chel&#269;icky and
Nicholas sprung up. Chel&#269;icky, in one of his letters
which has not been preserved, appears to have written
very sharply to the bishop, as in the existent <i>Reply to</i>
<i>Nicholas</i> he refers to the fact that he had offended his
correspondent. The subject of the <i>Reply</i>, as probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of the whole correspondence, is the one that then
absorbed all public interest in Bohemia: the correct
definition of the real presence of Christ in the sacrament
of communion. Chel&#269;icky maintains the real
presence of Christ in the sacrament, and lays stress on
the fact that Wycliffe, whose immense influence on the
religious views of the Bohemians is everywhere noticeable,
held the same doctrine. He sharply attacks the
view of the Taborite priests, which was similar to that
afterwards adopted by the Calvinists.</p>

<p>Though all dates concerning Chel&#269;icky are very uncertain,
it is probable that he ceased writing for some
time after the appearance of his first treatise. He felt,
as already stated, no joy in the victories of his countrymen,
and therefore probably remained silent till
comparative quiet returned to Bohemia. When this
result was obtained in consequence of the battle of
Lipan and the agreement between the Bohemians and
the Council of Basel known as the "compact," Chel&#269;icky
again began writing. His first considerable work
after the <i>Reply to Nicholas</i> is his <i>Postilla</i>, written probably
between 1434 and 1436. The <i>Postilla</i>, though the largest,
is far from being the most interesting work of Chel&#269;icky.
The <i>Postilla</i>, a commentary on the gospel of each Sunday
in the year, was a very favourite form of literary
expression among the Bohemian theologians. Besides
the Latin <i>Postilla</i> of Waldhauser, those of Hus and
Rokycan&mdash;both written in Bohemian&mdash;have already
been mentioned, and many others, the work of minor
writers, are still in existence. The leading ideas of
Chel&#269;icky, his absolute objection to bloodshed, his
detestation of all distinctions of rank and class, his
contempt for the luxury of the rich, and love of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
lowly life, these and other similar views are repeatedly&mdash;Chel&#269;icky
was indeed ever prone to repetition&mdash;expounded
in this as in his other works.</p>

<p>It will, however, give a far truer insight into the ideas
of Chel&#269;icky if we dwell more lengthily on his masterpiece,
the <i>S&iacute;t V&iacute;ry</i>, or "Net of Faith," where these views
are far more clearly expounded than elsewhere. This
book, which has only recently become widely known,
is one of the most valuable that have been written in
the Bohemian language. The democratic character
of the Slav race is noticeable in almost every line of
this book, and Chel&#269;icky's very scanty knowledge of
Latin, often disadvantageous to him when he attempted
theological definitions, here is the cause of the independence
and originality which characterise his work. Chel&#269;icky's
descriptions of the habits and manners of the
different classes of Bohemians in his time, though sometimes
coarse, are often quaint, and occasionally very
witty. The practice acquired by his earlier writings
had also greatly improved his style, and he writes here
with a facility that we do not find in his other works.
The subject of the <i>Net of Faith</i> is a passage from the
Bible<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>&mdash;which the author quotes at the beginning of his
work&mdash;which tells us how Simon, by order of Jesus, cast
out his net and the net broke. As Simon Peter's net
then broke in consequence of the multitude of fishes,
thus since the donation of Constantine, "damned persons,
heretics and offenders," have entered the net of faith,
which has been pierced by "the two whales," the Pope
and the Emperor, the embodiments of spiritual and
secular authority. The <i>Net of Faith</i> consists of two
parts, the contents of which are thus described by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>author of the preface to the first printed edition [1521]:&mdash;"The
first part," he writes, "explains whence and how
such fearful corruption entered the Holy Church, and
also states that he who would dig out its true ground
and foundation, which is Jesus, must first remove
much rubbish, which has been brought into the
Church by man; and then only will you find its true
foundation."</p>

<p>"The second part of the book explains how 'bands'<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
addicted to various and manifold learning and unchristian
religious practices sprung up and mightily
increased; and all these bands form a great obstacle to
the true knowledge of the creed of our Lord Jesus, for
they have clothed themselves with the spirit of haughtiness,
and are thus as adverse as possible to the humble
and poor Lord Jesus."</p>

<p>The first part of the work, as stated above, deals with
the corruption into which Christianity had fallen, and at
the same time formulates Chel&#269;icky's ideal Christianity
more clearly than the writer has done elsewhere. In
chapter xi. Chel&#269;icky writes of the primitive Church:
"Therefore, if we consider these early Christians, we will
see that they were sufficiently guided in their faith by
the Apostles according to the law of Christ; for that law
in itself is useful for the purpose of directing God's
people to salvation; for only by means of the direction
given by that law can God's people be led to that true
innocence which God loves in them; they should infallibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>seek Him with their whole heart, and preserve
truth and affection towards all people, friends or enemies;
they should wish or do evil to no one; and if such
things are done to them, they should suffer without
revenge, returning evil for evil neither to the good nor
to the evil; for such and similar matters does the law
of Christ enjoin. And those who will not be bound by
such injunctions cannot be justified before God. Therefore
is it impossible that worldly people, who love the
world and wish to live for the world, should submit
themselves to this law, for they would have to give up
the world if they wished to fulfil this law. Thus, indeed,
the first godly assemblies progressed in Christ's law:
abandoning totally the errors of the heathens, the incredulity
of the Jews, and all the vanities of this world,
they ... rapidly progressed without any of the rights of
citizens, and without the rule of a high priest, guided
only by the law of Christ."</p>

<p>"But later, when these twofold laws, those of the
State and those of the Pope, were established, then
immediately the state of Christianity was diminished
and it declined. And those who write chronicles reflect
on this, and we see it with our eyes that these two
laws produce the most harmful disturbances and death
of faith and of God's law.... I therefore ask, Is the
law of God sufficient without worldly laws to guide
and direct us in the path of truly Christian religion?
Then, though with trembling, I say, It is so, for Christ's
law was sufficient to guide Christ's manhood (<i>i.e.</i> Christ
as a man), as well as all His disciples, without the interference
of any worldly institutions."</p>

<p>The subversive character of these theories, which lead
to the assertion that the necessity of secular authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
is only founded on the wickedness of humanity, and
that the ideal state should be ruled by Christ alone,
did not escape Chel&#269;icky. In the last chapter of the
first part of the "Net" he writes: "From these things
(<i>i.e.</i> statements) some one might say that I insult the
(worldly) power. Let him say nothing of the sort, though
he may wish (to do so); for I do not insult it (<i>i.e.</i>
power), but honour it, as is seemly, and I say that it is
good when God uses it well, and through it carries out
what He considers good. But the evil which men do
and wish to carry out through it (worldly power), that
I blame before the people.... God is Lord of the
world, and could rule and restrain it without that power
if He wished to do so; therefore if we maintain that
He wishes to rule the world by means of temporal
authority, and that those men rule the world as officials
of the Lord God, then those who have power over the
world can restrain and command it easily if they ordain
that which they see is good for the world." It is evident
that this passage is evasive, and contains no answer to
the questions to which the former quotation naturally
gives rise.</p>

<p>The second part of the <i>Net of Faith</i> has as a second
heading the words, "Of the bands, and of each of
them separately;" but it must not be confused with
Chel&#269;icky's lost work, <i>Of the Bands in Bohemia</i>. Chel&#269;icky
deals first, and deals very severely, with the
"band" of the nobles. His animosity against those
who bear arms is sometimes very quaintly expressed.
He writes: "All the value of noble birth is founded
on an unjust invention of the heathens, who obtained
coats of arms from emperors or kings in reward of
some deed of prowess. And some buy these coats of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
arms for the sake of their vanity, such as a gate,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> a
head of a wolf or of a dog, a ladder, or half a horse, or
a trumpet, or a knife, or a pork sausage, or something
of that sort. In such coats of arms lies the value and
dignity of noble birth. And this nobility has the same
glory as the arms from which they derive the value of
their nobility. But if money did not fall to them as
well as noble birth, hunger would soon make them
ready to abandon their coats of arms and seize the
plough!... Therefore he who can prove that he is
well born, and has (in his arms) a ladder or half a
horse, receives letters (<i>i.e.</i> patents of nobility) declaring
that he is better born than Abel, the second son of
Adam, and he obtains such consideration that he is
always considered as being good; should he even
commit the worst actions, his coat of arms does not
permit that he should be bad."</p>

<p>These attacks on the nobility continue during three
chapters. The following passage contains a curious
description of the dress worn by the nobles of Bohemia
in the fifteenth century. Chel&#269;icky writes: "The men
wear copes reaching to the ground, or they wear a
short round jacket and a hood which reaches down to
the saddle of their horse, and with it a monk's cowl and
a neckerchief, or a short cloak, and with it long hair
reaching down to their shoulders, and on it a small
rough hat like a cone; they look out from under it
as from a dovecot, for verily they do not know what
monsters they make of themselves. The abominable
women also deck themselves out with so many petticoats
that they can hardly drag themselves along in them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>with fanciful toilets and graces that are not graceful.
Their head-dress is broad and high, and ends in a horn.
Thus do they walk about like the celebrated courtesans
of the Pope, to the surprise and offence of the whole
world. And all this is in consequence of their noble
birth, which reeks of injustice. Therefore can the true
faith never be insulted by heathens or by Jews as it
is by this race (the nobles), who found their claims on
their coats of arms, and who have unjustly entered into
the realm of the faithful. And they are odious in particular
to the crucified Jesus; for their proud ways are
contrary to the shame which He endured on the cross;
they who, acting in everything in a manner contrary to
Him for the purpose of worldly glory, yet wish to sit
at table with Him and share the gain of His suffering.
Therefore from all these causes they are displeasing to
God, and harmful and burdensome to men. For the
toiling community bears a heavy burden in the nobles;
for they devour the poor, and everything good that is
found in the land, that they grasp and devour, and greatly
do they harm the whole people."</p>

<p>It must not be thought that Chel&#269;icky's democratic
views were opposed to the privileges of the nobility only.
The special rights enjoyed by the citizens of some
Bohemian towns, the privileged position of the clergy,
even the intellectual superiority of the masters of the
university, all were equally odious to the fanatical leveller
Chel&#269;icky. Of the citizens he writes thus: "I shall now
speak of the knavery of the citizens, who are the strength
of Antichrist, adverse to Christ, an evil rabble, who are
full of boldness in committing bad actions, and help one
another in vigorously combating truth and in cunningly
suppressing it by means of hypocrisy; they speak well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of it (= truth) yet they are guests at the assemblies of
evil people, and of the shameless knaves who follow the
path of Judas. Therefore have these knavish townsmen
too grievously torn the net of faith when they resisted
the faith; they with their special town-privileges, which
are similar to the government of the heathens and
founded on the same principle; they are similar to the
bands who have coronets and crests, and in many
matters they draw at the yoke (that is, act) together.
Too much, indeed, has the knavery of the townsmen
increased, too strong are the worldly institutions, and
too great is the power of Antichrist; for through them
(the townsmen) he is prosperous in his war against
Christ. Therefore faith, like a net, could not contain
these many knaveries and remain intact; they have torn
it open by their opposition to Christ's truth; only the
lying and dead phantom of faith have they left, and the
false name of Christianity."</p>

<p>Somewhat later Chel&#269;icky develops his views on the
foundation of cities. It has been conjectured that
he derived these views from the Waldenses; but the
influence of the Waldenses on the Hussite movement,
and on Chel&#269;icky and the Bohemian Brethren in particular,
is a question on which the principal Bohemian
authorities disagree. A similar theory as to the origin
of cities can also be traced to Wycliffe, who is perhaps
the "Magister Protiva" whom Chel&#269;icky quotes. In
any case, the theory of an original communism, which
was destroyed by the murderer Cain, is very characteristic
of Chel&#269;icky. He writes: "Magister Protiva, dealing
with the foundation of cities, spoke thus: Cain, after the
murder of his brother, built a town, the foundation of
which was the cause that he acquired goods by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of robbery and violence. Thus was he enabled to enjoy
the fruits of his thievery, and by the invention of landmarks
he changed the former simplicity of men's lives,
of their weights and measures, into craftiness or cunning,
and he introduced corruption. He first laid down landmarks,
and he first fortified towns with walls; and being
afraid of those whom he and his band had offended and
robbed, he assembled his followers in his towns."</p>

<p>Chel&#269;icky then deals with the clergy. He is particularly
severe on the mendicant friars, of whom, he writes
thus: "It is thus as regards the poverty of the monks:
If it were true poverty it would be blessed, but their
poverty is insatiable and endures no want; therefore
has it only the name of poverty. Although they may
not have many good treasures, yet they can gather
together so much that they can live in abundance just
as he who possesses treasures. Thus (such a monk)
is called poor though he is free from all the privations
which poverty causes. Many citizens indeed would
accept this sort of poverty if they could&mdash;relying on
the regulations that permit constant begging&mdash;gather
together so much money that they could have a more
abundant fare than their neighbours, even should the
latter earn much money by usury. And if a poor
monk obtains such abundance for his dinner-table that
he disdains beef and delicious peas with fat bacon, but
wags his tail when he sees game, birds or other delicacies
that are better than peas, then he has got himself a good
livelihood by his begging; and he and his companions
the other monks have made a better business out of
begging than some squire who has a plough and two
fields, or even a large farm. Far indeed is such a
mendicant friar from poverty; as he is always begging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
he would not scorn it should some one offer him gold;
the covetous monk would stick it into his bag, buy himself
value (that is, an annuity), give up the obligation of
begging and rather become a lord, winning from God
with a trump."</p>

<p>After passing judgment on the priesthood, Chel&#269;icky
proceeds to criticise the men of learning, or rather the
theologians, for in his time, particularly in Bohemia,
scarcely any other learning was known. He writes:
"As regards the bands of masters of colleges, they are
among Christians, those of whom, one would think, that
they were as a light of the world, and that the faith of
Christ had in them its strongest pledge; (this) in consequence
of their sure faculty of judgment and of their
virtues, and also (would one hope) that in time of persecution
the faithful people would find support among
them. When, in time of persecution, the frivolous run
away, they who are stronger in faith should take the
weight on themselves; for one would think that they
only studied science so zealously&mdash;and gave it to be
understood that they do so for the sake of faith&mdash;because
they wished to defend the faith against heretics, and
against the other enemies of the Christian truth. But
these their speeches which they boastfully deliver are not
true, and they have given no proof (of their zeal) during
the present time of persecution. I know of no one
whom, with all their learning, they have assisted. That
is a living proof. As to Hus, he had the faith in himself.
Had he not been granted special strength by God, the
learning of the colleges, all of them that there are in
the Romish Church, would have stifled the faith in him;
for all these colleges flocked together to Constance
against him. But dear God gave him so much holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
learning, that the Antichristian spirit of all those ravens
did not possess sufficient learning to extinguish in him
the true faith.... What the principal Antichrist's popes,
cardinals, bishops, abbots, the bands of monks and
parsons, could not obtain for their own advantage, and
for the benefit of their dishonest cause, adverse to Christ,
that the masters of colleges have succeeded in obtaining.
Thus these college-men, as if they grieved for their father
Antichrist, and for the shame that befell him when truth
was proclaimed, have employed all their learning at
two councils, which lasted several years, one at Constance
and the other at Basel, for the purpose of skilfully
laying snares against the truth; and for this have they
sought the aid of worldly power, that they might carry
through that which their learning had discovered, and
on which they had deliberated, and thus prove the truth
of their teaching, and they had already won over to
their side<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> the entire might of the empire, so that having
pronounced the truth heretical and condemned it, they
might destroy it by means of the imperial power. But
God, who observes the thoughts and counsels of the
wicked, did not allow them to obtain that which in their
deliberations they had aimed at, and for which they had
employed their learning."</p>

<p>I will give a last quotation from the <i>Net of Faith</i>,
illustrating Chel&#269;icky's views as to the manner in which
the Church first became possessed of worldly goods. It
will be noticed how naively he here refers to the grievances
of the Bohemian peasants of his time, and without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>hesitation speaks of them as existing at the time of
Constantine. "The emperor," Chel&#269;icky writes, "having
made a lord of the Pope by means of the gift of a
royal estate, and having given him the honour of royal
glory, ordered that everywhere in his dominions churches
should be built, and fields with ploughs attached to
them. Then the apostles of Antichrist, having settled
down in these churches, and being clever and thrifty
men, amply enlarged the gift of Constantine; besides
their (church) farms, they obtained lordly donations,
woods, fishponds, taxes on the people, rich tithes; they
taxed all religious functions and their services, and for
the purpose of obtaining money they introduced the
ringing of bells, and in all the land near their church
they sell (religious rites) at the burial of the dead."</p>

<p>I have dealt somewhat more fully with the <i>Net of</i>
<i>Faith</i>, as being Chel&#269;icky's most valuable and most characteristic
work. It will therefore be sufficient to notice
but briefly his remaining writings, particularly as there is
a marked decline in the interest of what he composed
after the year 1340, when the <i>Net of Faith</i> appeared.
Of the four books which&mdash;following Dr. Goll&mdash;I have
called Chel&#269;icky's principal works, it only remains to
notice his <i>Reply to Rokycan</i>, which is generally considered
the most important of his polemical writings.
While Rokycan, the Utraquist archbishop, was in exile
from Prague, he met Chel&#269;icky, and a conversation between
them began concerning "the men who are called
priests, and the slight advantage they have conferred on
men." The conversation was followed by a correspondence
of which only this treatise has been preserved.
It is a lengthy diatribe against the "band" of the ecclesiastics,
and attacks not only the Roman clergy, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the priests of the Bohemian National (Utraquist) Church,
whom Rokycan, now returned from exile, was endeavouring
to organise hierarchically.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, many minor works of Chel&#269;icky
have become known, some quite recently. Of these, the
most important are the <i>Exposition of the Passion according</i>
<i>to St. John</i> and the treatise <i>On the Beast and its Image</i>.
They are commentaries, the former on the last chapter
of the Gospel, the latter on the Revelation of St. John, a
saint whose particular influence on Chel&#269;icky is often
noticeable. Of other minor works, the treatise <i>On the</i>
<i>Body of Christ</i> and that <i>On the Foundation of Worldly</i>
<i>Laws</i> are most worthy of notice.</p>

<p>Though he cannot be considered its founder, Chel&#269;icky's
influence contributed greatly to the formation of
the society of the "Bohemian Brethren," I have, however,
preferred to deal with the "Unity," as it was called,
in the next chapter, when I shall consecutively deal with
its theological writers from the founders of the association
down to Komensk&yacute;.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In other than theological works the period of the
Hussite wars is very poor. Of historians, Lawrence of
B&#345;ezov and Mladenovi&#269; have already been mentioned.
It remains to notice a series of chroniclers, whose writings
I have already quoted, and who are known as the
Sta&#345;i Letopisove Ce&#353;ti, or "ancient Bohemian chroniclers."
These writings, the work of different authors,
many of whom were probably eye-witnesses of the events
which they describe, form a chronological account,
written in the national language, of the occurrences in
Bohemia from 1378 to 1526. The most interesting part
of these chronicles refers to the period of the Hussite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
wars, and to Zi&#382;ka's campaigns in particular. A considerable
portion of the graphic account of Zi&#382;ka's campaign
in Hungary and his retreat from that country
has been translated into French by Professor L&eacute;ger in
his <i>Nouvelles &Eacute;tudes Slaves</i>. "Written by a Xenophon,"
the learned Professor truly says, "in good Greek of
Athens, it would no doubt have become classic." The
account of the campaign is unfortunately not adapted
to quotation on a small scale. One legal work also
belongs to this period, <i>The Book of Law</i> of Ctibor
Cimburg of Tova&#269;ov, generally known as <i>Kniha Tova&#269;ovsk&aacute;</i>,
or the Book of Tova&#269;ov. The same writer has
left an allegorical dialogue entitled <i>Truth's Quarrel with</i>
<i>Falsehood</i>.</p>

<p>The period of the Hussite wars produced but few
poetical works, and these, with the exception of Zi&#382;ka's
beautiful war-song, have little value. They consist
mainly of coarse invectives exchanged between the
Romanists and the Utraquists. Far more songs written
by the friends of Rome than by their adversaries have
been preserved. This is, however, probably a consequence
of the fact that for a long period every Bohemian
work written in a sense hostile to Rome was sought out
and destroyed. A curious Romanist song is the one
that has the words, "Woe to you, Hus," as a refrain. I
will quote the last strophe, in which the writer thus
addresses the Hussites:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"You are wanton like bulls,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cows, mice, Moors;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Murder, robbery, unchristian craft,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>These form your religion:</i><br /></span>

HUMANISTS AND THEOLOGIANS</h2>


<p>The comparative tranquillity in Bohemia which was the
consequence of the battle of Lipan (1434), and of the
agreement between the Bohemians and the Church of
Rome which is known as the "compact," naturally had
a favourable influence on the intellectual development of
the country. The period which, beginning with the last
years of the fifteenth century, ends with the downfall of
Bohemia in 1620, is the one in which the Bohemian
language obtained its greatest extension. I shall again
refer to this point at the beginning of Chapter VI.</p>

<p>Two events of the greatest importance to the development
of Bohemian literature occurred in the latter half
of the fifteenth century. The one is the growth of the
humanist movement in Bohemia; the other is the foundation
of the sect of the "Bohemian Brethren." Utterly
opposed to one another as the views of the humanists
and the Bohemian Brethren were, the two currents of
thought were not quite without reciprocal influence.
Some of the best writers of the "Unity," as the association
of the Bohemian Brethren was generally called,
such as Blahoslav and the translators of the Bible of
Kralice, show proof of thorough study of the Bohemian
writings of the humanists. On the other hand, even
such an extreme "ultramontane" as the humanist Bohnslav
of Lobkovic does not display such absolute and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
abject submission to the Church of Rome as we find
in Southern Europe. Lobkovic admits, to a certain
extent, the corruption of the Church of Rome, on
which his countrymen laid so great stress, and his language
when referring to Pope Alexander VI. is very
outspoken.</p>

<p>Though, in consequence of the Hussite wars, the
humanist movement was late in reaching Bohemia, it
had there a considerable influence, though of a rather
indirect nature. No great original work can be attributed
to the Bohemian humanists, and when they used
their native language it was generally for the purpose of
translations, by which, it is true, they greatly enriched
and developed it.</p>

<p>In no country had the humanist great sympathy with
the national language. In Bohemia the early humanists,
whose representative man is Bohuslav of Lobkovic,
positively detested it. Lobkovic's often-quoted epigram
on Gregory Gelenius,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> who had translated some of his
Latin verses into Bohemian, clearly expresses his feeling
on the matter. He wrote: "Into the national language
has some one translated my verses. Now the people
read them, the lords and nobles. But I am indignant
at this work of the two-legged donkey,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and I commend
his wit and his muse to perdition."</p>

<p>If the early humanists had little sympathy for Bohemia,
the national or Utraquist party felt the strongest
distrust of the "new learning." A movement that originated
in Italy, the site of the Papal power, to which
Bohemia refused allegiance, and reached the country
through Germany, the ever-hostile neighbour-land, could
not appeal to the Bohemians. It must, however, be remarked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>that the undoubted feeling of antipathy which
existed between Lobkovic, Slechta, and other early
humanists on one, and the mass of the Bohemian
people on the other side, did not include many well-known
humanists who adhered to the then predominant
Utraquist Church of Bohemia, and did much, at
least by means of translations, to improve the language
of their country.</p>

<p>Among the early strictly "ultramontane" Bohemian
humanists, the most prominent personage is <span class="smcap">Bohuslav</span>
<span class="smcap">Hasi&#353;tein of Lobkovic</span>. Born about the year 1460, he
was educated in the doctrine of the Utraquist Church,
to which his father, a firm adherent of King Georg, had
belonged. It is not quite certain when he was formally
received into the Roman Church, but this no doubt happened
during his stay in Italy. At a very early age he
proceeded to the University of Bologna, where he pursued
his studies for some time, and no doubt also
became acquainted with the teachers of the humanist
learning, of which Bologna was then a stronghold.
Henceforth Bohnslav is for his whole lifetime a humanist,
with all the qualities and defects which belonged to
that state of life.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1482, Bohuslav returned
to Bohemia, and here, at an exceptionally early age,
obtained the dignity of provost of the Vy&#353;ehrad at
Prague. Humanism had by this time spread in Bohemia,
and he became the centre of a small society
which devoted itself entirely to the study of the classic
languages. Of this small group the shining light, of
course after Bohuslav himself, was Victorin Cornelius
ze V&#353;ehrd, the friend and afterwards the detested enemy
of Bohuslav. One of the minor lights of this <i>c&eacute;nacle</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
has described the position of the two leading Bohemian
humanists in the following Latin verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Primus Boleslaus, Cornelius altera Lux est</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sidera nos alii, sed sine luce sumus."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the year 1490 Lobkovic undertook an extensive
voyage to Palestine and Egypt. On his return to
Europe, Lobkovic, who, as his correspondence very
clearly proves, was by no means devoid of political
ambition, attempted to play a more important part in
the affairs of his country. For this purpose mainly
Lobkovic aspired to the important bishopric of Olm&uuml;tz
in Moravia, and he was unanimously chosen by the
chapter, which, according to very ancient regulations,
had the right of election. Unfortunately about this time
Alexander VI. was chosen as Pope, and he immediately
appointed to the see of Olm&uuml;tz the Cardinal of Monreale,
a relation of the Borgia family. Even the strongest
partisans of the papal cause were incensed at this
decision, which intrusted the bishopric of Olm&uuml;tz to an
Italian, ignorant of the Bohemian, and even of the better-known
German language, at a moment when the influence
of the Bohemian Brethren was very strong in Moravia.
A letter of remonstrance was, in the name of the principal
Moravian nobles, addressed to Pope Alexander. This
remonstrance, couched in rather strong language, was
probably the work of Lobkovic, and has been printed
by Professor Joseph Truhl&aacute;&#345; in his recently published
collection of the Latin letters of Bohnslav of Lobkovic.
This letter had no result, and Lobkovic appears never
to have forgiven Pope Alexander. We possess several
Latin epigrams written by him on that pontiff, in which
Lobkovic has followed Juvenal and Martial so faithfully
that I must refrain from quotation. Even after the death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of Alexander, Lobkovic in his <i>Farragines</i> published an
epigram stating that even the guardian of hell had declined
to admit Pope Borgia, as he might corrupt the
other inmates of the infernal regions!</p>

<p>That Lobkovic, however, remained a stanch adherent
of the Church of Rome is proved by an occurrence
that took place somewhat later, and caused great excitement
among the small group of Bohemian humanists.
It is very characteristic of the times. Some citizens of
Prague, who belonged to the most moderate faction
of the Utraquist party, had, in 1493, presented an
address to the Roman pontiff. With little political
foresight, Lobkovic, thoroughly believing that the
separation of Bohemia from the Roman Church had
now at least come to an end, wrote an enthusiastic
letter to John of Domoslav, a writer in the law-courts
of Prague, and one of his very numerous correspondents.
In this letter, written in his best Latinity,
Lobkovic rejoiced over the final suppression of heresy,
and enclosed a prayer in verse in which he invoked the
aid of Providence for the purpose of the restoration of
Bohemia to Catholicism. What followed is not very
clear, but it seems that Domoslav showed Lobkovic's
poem to Victorin Cornelius ze V&#353;ehrd, who had that
year been appointed to high office in the law-courts of
Prague, and was his official superior. V&#353;ehrd, a fervent
Utraquist, was indignant at the suggestion of a reunion
with Rome, and, as a true humanist, he also immediately
composed a Latin poem, parodying that of Lobkovic.
The poem ended with the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Boemicis sanguis si quid tibi restal aviti</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Roboris, indigno subtrahe colla jugo!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Qui domini tanto servasti jussa superni</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tempore, papalibus contaminari cave!"</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>
<p>This parody V&#353;ehrd communicated to Domoslav, who&mdash;it
is difficult to understand from what motive, unless
it was sheer love of mischief-making&mdash;immediately forwarded
it to Lobkovic.</p>

<p>The indignation of Lobkovic was very great, and he
expressed it in a lengthy very Ciceronian letter to
Domoslav, which is contained in Professor Truhl&aacute;&#345;'s
collection of the letters of Lobkovic. He regrets that
Domoslav should have sent to him "the blasphemies
of one who, with sacrilegious mouth, raves against the
Church of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Lobkovic then proceeds to compare
his former friend to Dathan and Abiram, Wycliffe,
Arius, and the Emperor Julian. After a long and tedious
polemical discourse, Lobkovic very characteristically ends
his letter by stating that the heretic, besides his other
misdeeds, had "placed a tribrachys in the fifth place of
his first verse;" a lengthy list of similar errors follows,
and concludes with the remark that V&#353;ehrd had, at the
end of the last line of his poem, used the second syllable
of the word "papalibus"&mdash;in the passage I have quoted&mdash;as
long, contrary to what he had done in an earlier
passage of the poem.</p>

<p>In his later years Lobkovic spent most of his time at
his castle of Hassi&#353;tein, and does not seem to have continued
his attempt to obtain political influence. He
collected a large library at his castle, and devoted his
time to study and to the company of the humanist
friends who visited him at Hassi&#353;tein. He died there in
1512.</p>

<p>As Lobkovic wrote only in Latin, a writer on Bohemian
literature can deal with his works very briefly.
The fact that a Bohemian noble of high rank wrote in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>sense favourable to Rome at a time when almost the
whole of his country was opposed to that Church, has
caused Lobkovic to receive much exaggerated praise from
writers whose literary judgment was guided by their political
and religious sympathies. His works, both in prose
and in poetry, are numerous, but have little value. Even
in the best of his elegies he is far inferior to his contemporary
Sannazaro. The Latinity of his letters is certainly
very good, and he ranks very high among the humanists
in this respect; but the elaborate style hardly dissimulates
poverty of thought and narrow-minded prejudice. His
letter or harangue to King Vladislav, written 1497, is in
itself sufficient to convict Lobkovic of incapacity as a
politician. The purpose of the letter was to entreat the
king to re-establish the Roman Catholic archbishopric
of Prague, but Lobkovic proceeds to beg the king to
extirpate heresy in Bohemia entirely. He quotes, as
examples for the king, Charles the Great, who forcibly
converted the heathen Saxons, and Ferdinand of Arragon,
"who alone among kings emulates you in virtue,"
by whose agency Baetica, the noblest province of Spain,
was restored to our Christian fold. It is, of course, a
matter of opinion whether the forcible reconversion of
Bohemia to the Roman Church, such as actually took
place in the seventeenth century, was desirable or not;
but it requires but a very slight knowledge of Bohemian
history to realise that such an attempt at the time of the
reign of Vladislav was doomed to most certain failure.
It is, however, possible that the letter was intended merely
to be a rhetorical exercise.</p>

<p>The influence of Lobkovic on the development of
Bohemian literature was undoubtedly harmful. The
outspoken contempt for the national language expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
by so renowned a humanist could not but discourage its
cultivation by others. Lobkovic, in his strange identification
of Bohemian writings with what he considered
heretical opinions, is an undoubted forerunner of the
Jesuit book-destroyers of the seventeenth century. A
recent critic writes: "These Latin works of Bohemian
humanists appear as a vast sepulchre, bearing the
epitaph: 'Here, under an elaborate Latin monument,
true Slav hearts lie buried.'"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though he can scarcely be considered as a humanist,
John of Lobkovic should be mentioned in connection
with his brother Bohnslav. Differing in most things from
his brother, with whom, in consequence of questions of
succession, he was for some time on bad terms, he used
the Bohemian language for his two works which we
possess. He wrote a curious work entitled <i>Knowledge</i>
<i>and Instruction for my son Jaroslav, as to what he should</i>
<i>do and what omit</i>. The book, written in 1504, was afterwards
printed under the less unwieldy title of the <i>True</i>
<i>Bohemian Mentor</i>. It enjoyed great popularity in Bohemia,
and a copy of this book was a frequent gift of fathers
to their sons.</p>

<p>As a proof of the noble spirit in which the book is
written, I shall quote a portion of the chapter entitled "On
subject people (<i>i.e.</i> serfs), and how you should behave
towards them." John of Lobkovic writes: "Be gracious
to your subjects, if you wish that the Lord God should
be gracious to you. For if you forgive them their
offences, then will the Lord God forgive you your
offences. For we say in the Lord's Prayer, 'Forgive us
our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against
us.' Thus we ourselves, when we sing the Lord's prayer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
submit to this, saying, 'Forgive us as we forgive.' And
thus if we do not forgive their offences to those who
have offended us, our own sins will not be forgiven to
us by God.</p>

<p>"Hear cheerfully every one, rich or poor, on his request,
and either help him to justice or order those
whose business it is to do so. By this you will obtain
the love of the people and their prayers to God for your
long life and happiness in everything.</p>

<p>"If some poor man of yours (subject or serf) has
committed some not very great offence against you, forgive
him once and twice; even if he offends a third
time, be merciful. Only if it is a serious matter, justly
meriting the penalty of death, then act towards him as is
fit.... Give just judgment on your subjects and every
one on whom you sit in judgment, for that is God's
command.</p>

<p>"When sitting in judgment, pay no regard to the
person if he be rich or poor, or to favour or disfavour,
or to presents, which blind the judge and disgrace justice.
Deliver judgment impartially to every one, this
one or that."</p>

<p>Lobkovic's advice as to the treatment of serfs is very
interesting, as having been written only a few years after
the Diet of Bohemia had in 1487 established serfdom,
which was contrary to the original customs of Bohemia.
It is certain that the rule of the Bohemian nobles over
the peasantry belonging to the same race was very mild,
and that the condition of the peasantry became far worse
when, after the battle of the White Mountain, the landowner
was almost always a foreigner, generally a German.
John of Lobkovic is also to be mentioned as a traveller.
In 1493 he undertook a journey to Palestine by way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Venice, Dalmatia, and Greece, of which he has left us a
description entitled <i>A Pilgrimage to the Grave of God</i>.</p>

<p>Of Bohemian humanists the most important one next to
Bohnslav of Lobkovic is <span class="smcap">Victorin Cornelius Ze V&#353;ehrd</span>,
born at Chrudim in 1460. His friendship with Bohnslav
of Lobkovic, which was ended by a bitter religious dispute,
has already been mentioned. V&#353;ehrd for some
time held an important office at the law-courts of Prague,
which he lost in 1497, it is said through the influence
of Bohnslav of Lobkovic. V&#353;ehrd was one of the most
learned lawyers of his time, and he has left us a legal
work in Bohemian entitled <i>Ten Books on the Rights of</i>
<i>the Bohemian Land</i>, which has great historical value.
After his rupture with Bohnslav Lobkovic, V&#353;ehrd seems
to have abandoned his exclusive devotion to Latin.
Belonging to the National Utraquist Church, he was
devoid of the dislike to the national language which
up to the beginning of the seventeenth century was
general among the adherents of the Roman Church.
He, however, attempted no original work, but endeavoured
to aid the development of the Bohemian
language by enriching it with translations from foreign
authors. He has himself explained his purpose in the
preface to his translation of St. John Chrysostom's work
<i>On the Amendment of the Fallen</i>. He writes: "I have
gladly translated (this book) for this reason also, that
I hope thus to extend, to ennoble, to increase our
language; for it is not so narrow and unpolished as
it seems to some. Its abundance and richness can be
seen by this, that whatever can be expressed in Greek
or in Latin can be so in Bohemian also.... May
others compose new books written in Latin and&mdash;pouring
water into the sea&mdash;extend the use of the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
language. I wish, by translating the books and works
of really good men into Bohemian, rather to enrichen
the poor than that, flattering the rich with bad and
unwelcome presents, I should be despised and insulted.
I could indeed write Latin as well as others who are
my equals; but knowing that I am a Bohemian, I will
indeed learn Latin, but write and speak in Bohemian."
Besides the above-mentioned translation, V&#353;ehrd also
translated into Bohemian several works of St. Cyprian.
It must be mentioned that when translating from the
Greek, V&#353;ehrd used Latin versions. With the exception
of Piseck&yacute;, the knowledge of Greek which the Bohemian
humanists possessed was not very extensive. V&#353;ehrd
did not confine himself to humanistic studies, but continued
to practise as a lawyer up to his death in 1520.</p>

<p>Among other Bohemian humanists, Gregory Hrub&yacute; z
Jeleni and his son Sigismund&mdash;both are better known
under the Latinised name of "Gelenius"&mdash;deserve
special notice. Gregory Gelenius, born about the year
1450, was one of the most industrious translators of
classical works into the Bohemian language, and as
such has deserved well of the language of his country.
The works of Cicero particularly appealed to him, and
he not only translated several of them into Bohemian,
but also published an <i>Admonition to the Citizens of</i>
<i>Prague</i>, which is an adaptation of Cicero's speech <i>Pro</i>
<i>Lege Manilia</i>. Gelenius did not limit his translations
to the classical writers. He translated several of the
Latin works of Petrarch, the <i>Encomium Mori&aelig;</i> of
Erasmus, whose fame in Bohemia was very great, and
some of the Latin poems of Bohnslav of Lobkovic. I
have already alluded to the indignation with which
Bohnslav received this attempt to translate his verses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
into his national language, which he so greatly despised.
Gregory Gelenius died in 1514.</p>

<p>Gregory's son, <span class="smcap">Sigismund Gelenius</span>, was perhaps the
most learned of the Bohemian humanists. Born in 1497,
he travelled in Italy when very young, and during a stay
at Venice acquired a thorough knowledge of Greek. He
also seems to have been acquainted with the Semitic
languages. Sigismund endeavoured, but unsuccessfully,
to obtain a professorship of Greek at the University of
Prague. Disappointed by his failure, he left Bohemia,
and, on the suggestion of Erasmus, proceeded to Basel,
where he was employed by the publisher John Frobenius,
who was then preparing a series of editions of
classical authors. Sigismund Gelenius is one of the
greatest philologians of the sixteenth century, and obtained
special notice as editor and annotator of the
works of Ammianus Marcellinus, Pliny, and Livy. He
spent his whole life at Basel, and refused repeated invitations
to return to his country. The celebrated Bohemian
Brother, Blahoslav, who visited him at Basel in
1550, has recorded that he still "spoke Bohemian very
well." Sigismund Gelenius died at Basel in 1554.</p>

<p>In connection with the two Geleniuses I shall mention
Wenceslas Hladi&#269;, or <span class="smcap">Piseck&yacute;</span>, as he called himself, from
the town Pisek, where he was born in 1482. He studied
at the University of Prague, and there took his degrees
as Bachelor and as Master of Arts. He afterwards
travelled in Italy, having been chosen by Gregory Gelenius
as tutor or companion to his son Sigismund, who
was to pursue his studies there. Piseck&yacute; and his pupil
proceeded to Padua, and from there to Bologna. Bologna
was then a centre for the numerous Greek refugees who
had after the fall of Constantinople left their country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
As a true Bohemian of his time, Piseck&yacute;, while in Italy,
engaged in a theological controversy with a monk at
Bologna on the subject of communion in two kinds.
The Latin treatise which he published on this subject
was afterwards translated into Bohemian by Gregory
Gelenius. Wenceslas Piseck&yacute; was indeed not influenced
in his religious opinions by his stay in Italy, and always
remained faithful to the Utraquist Church. In one of
his letters he complains that his country is little known
in foreign lands&mdash;a complaint that a Bohemian of the
present is unfortunately still entitled to echo&mdash;and writes
bitterly of &AElig;n&aelig;as Sylvius, whose book on Bohemia was
then and long afterwards considered the standard authority
on the subject. He writes: "&AElig;n&aelig;as Sylvius, who
was ignorant of the laws of historical writing as they
have been transmitted to us by the Greek writers, deals
in the manner of a gladiator (gladiatorio prorsus animo)
with the Bohemians."</p>

<p>The most important result of Piseck&yacute;'s Greek studies
was a Bohemian translation of Isocrates's oration to
Demonikos, which his protector, Gregory Gelenius, published
in 1512, a year after the premature death of
Piseck&yacute;, who died suddenly at Venice from the plague,
or, according to other accounts, from poison. Piseck&yacute;'s
version, in which for the first time a Greek work was
translated directly into Bohemian, still has great value,
and has by a recent critic been described as a model of
Bohemian diction. As a proof of the importance that
was attached to the translation, we may quote the very
simple Bohemian "Epitaph" which Gregory Gelenius
prefixed to the work of Piseck&yacute;. It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"The town of Pisek was my birthplace;</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The University of Prague gave me learning;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The Italian land taught me Greek.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Therefore have I left a memorial behind me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Isocrates translated into Bohemian speech.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>More work I cannot undertake, for I am dead.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Good Bohemian, be thankful that I accomplished this,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Now that my earthly life is ended."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another very distinguished Bohemian humanist was
<span class="smcap">John &#352;lechta</span>, who was afterwards ennobled and received
the title "ze V&#353;ehrd". He must not, however, be
confused with Viktorin Cornelius ze V&#353;ehrd, who has
already been mentioned. Born in 1446, &#352;lechta was
like Bohnslav of Lobkovic, with whom he was on
terms of friendship, and many of the early Bohemian
humanists, a fervent adherent of the Church of Rome.
Like Lobkovic, also, he had a strong dislike to the
language and to the religion of his country. Like most
humanists, he was a great letter-writer, and many of his
letters, some of which are in his own language, have
been preserved.</p>

<p>A curious proof of the intense dislike which some,
though by no means all, Bohemian humanists felt for
the peculiar religious views which attracted the attention
of foreigners to their country can be found in the
correspondence of &#352;lechta with Erasmus of Rotterdam.
&#352;lechta, in a letter referring to the "Bohemian Brethren,"
informed his correspondent that "an emissary of
'Pikardus'<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> had infected first Zi&#382;ka's army and then all
Bohemia with pestiferous doctrines of sin; thence the
'Bohemian Brethren' proceeded to recognise communion
in the two kinds, and to choose as bishops and priests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>rude laymen who had no culture, were married, and had
children."</p>

<p>The answer of Erasmus is very characteristic; he
regrets that the Bohemians do not conform to the
universal custom as regards communion, but he openly
states that he does not understand why Christ's original
regulations on this subject have been changed. As to
the choosing of their own bishops and priests, this does
not, to Erasmus, appear contrary to the early regulations
(consuetudo veterum).</p>

<p>The most ambitious work of &#352;lechta was, no doubt,
his <i>Microcosmus</i>. The book, which was written in Latin,
has been lost, and we can therefore only judge of it from
the preface that is still existent, and from the numerous
references to it that can be found in the correspondence
of &#352;lechta and his friends. &#352;lechta appears to have
forwarded copies of his book to many of his friends,
wishing to obtain their opinion as to its contents. In
his preface &#352;lechta declares that he intended dealing
with the relations of the body to the soul according to
Plato's works, of which, by means of a Latin translation,
he appears to have had some knowledge.</p>

<p>Another Bohemian humanist who, by means of translations
into his native language, has deserved well of his
country, is Nicolas Kon&aacute;&#269;, or Finitor, according to the
Latinised version of his name. Bohemian writers on
the literature of their country devote much space to
notices of the numerous translations made by Finitor,
but it will here be sufficient to mention that the most
important of these Bohemian translations was that of
&AElig;n&aelig;as Sylvius's work on Bohemia. Late in life Finitor
wrote, in Bohemian, an allegorical work of mystic tendency
that enjoyed great celebrity in its time. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
work, that only appeared after the death of Kon&aacute;&#269; in
1546, is entitled <i>The Book of Lamentation and Complaint</i>
<i>of Justice, the Queen and Mistress of all Virtues</i>.</p>

<p>It would be easy to continue this enumeration of
Bohemian humanists. Though these translators devoted
themselves rather too much to the works of the fathers
of the Church and to contemporary writers such as
Erasmus and Sebastian Brand, and too little to the real
classics, yet their work greatly contributed to the improvement
and development of the Bohemian language.
The study of ancient literature, which was undoubtedly
furthered by their work, had a refining and elevating
influence on some of the men who, in the last years
of Bohemian independence, played a prominent part in
the politics of their country. I shall return to this point
in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Writing for readers who are not Bohemians, it will be
sufficient to mention but two other Bohemian humanists,
the two Veleslavins. They enjoyed great celebrity, and
it became customary to call the period in which they
flourished&mdash;the last years of the sixteenth and the first
of the seventeenth century&mdash;"the age of Veleslavin."</p>

<p>Adam Daniel Veleslavin, born in 1545, studied at the
University of Prague, and took his degrees there. He
afterwards for some time lectured on history at that
university, but after his marriage in 1576 to the daughter
of the celebrated printer and publisher, George Melantrich,
he became a partner in the business of his
father-in-law. In this capacity he greatly furthered
the development of Bohemian literature, and it is due
to him that many books in that language were printed.
Thoroughly acquainted with the art of writing his own
language, he thoroughly supervised all the books that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
issued from his press, and, as Dr. Jire&#269;ek writes, there
is not one of them that doesn't show traces of having
been corrected by him. He was occupied with lexicographic
works in his own language, and with translations
from other languages. Of his many works we may
mention his <i>Politia Historica</i>, a translation, or rather
adaptation, of the vast German work of Lauterbeck,
which is entitled <i>Das Regentenbuch</i>, and his translation
of the work of &AElig;n&aelig;as Sylvius on Bohemia, which, in
spite of its hostility to their country, greatly interested
the Bohemians. The preface to this edition, Veleslavin's
own work, contains an interesting account of the early
historians of Bohemia.</p>

<p>Of his mainly philological works, Veleslavin's <i>Silva</i>
<i>Quadrilinguis</i> and his <i>Nomenclator Quadrilinguis</i> are the
most important; both contain alphabetic vocabularies
of the Bohemian, Latin, Greek, and German languages.
The works issued from the Veleslavin press are so numerous
that it seems certain that he had many collaborators
in his critical work. Bernard of Hodijov and William
Ostroveck&yacute; are specially mentioned as having acted as
"sub-editors" to the works published by Veleslavin.
Though he appears to have by no means been a man of
genius, the influence of Veleslavin on Bohemian literature
was very great, and it was an undoubted loss to the
country that he died prematurely in 1599.</p>

<p>The son of Adam Daniel, <span class="smcap">Adam Samuel Veleslavin</span>
was born in 1592, only seven years before the death of
his father. In his youth he was involved in the domestic
quarrels and civil war which troubled Bohemia in the
years 1618 to 1620. He was an enthusiastic adherent
of the "Nationalist" party, to use a modern expression,
and was obliged to fly from Bohemia after the fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
battle of the White Mountain. We have no record of
him from the time that his exile began. His fortune
was confiscated by the triumphant Catholics, and his
printing-presses, which he had inherited from his father,
were made over to the Jesuits. He had up to the downfall
of Bohemian independence continued the editorial
labours of his father, and had completed the publishing
of several works begun by him. He also published
in 1613 an edition of the Bible dedicated to the "defenders,"
that is, the leaders of the Protestant movement.</p>

<p>In connection with the humanists, who also wrote
much Latin verse, we now turn to the Bohemian poetry
of this period. But even the "golden age" of Bohemian
literature, as the sixteenth and the first years of
the seventeenth century have often been called, produced
little valuable poetry. It is indeed only in the
earliest times and again in the present century that
Bohemia has been distinguished through its poetry. The
sixteenth and seventeenth century produced indeed a
certain amount of satirical poetry, but it requires no
further notice.</p>

<p>The only writer of this period who composed a large
amount of Bohemian poetry was <span class="smcap">Simon Lomnick&yacute;</span> of
Bude&#269;, born in 1552, who was much praised as a poet
by his contemporaries. Though most of his poetical writings,
particularly his more ambitious efforts, are devoid
of true poetic feeling, yet, as being the one poet of that
time who wrote in the national language, his place is
marked in an account of Bohemian literature. He enjoyed,
as already mentioned, great celebrity, and was often
described as "the poet of the Bohemian land," "Poeta
Cechicus," or the "founder of Bohemian song." More
interesting than his larger works are his shorter songs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
<i>vers d'occasion</i> as they may be called, which he sent to his
patrons, the Bohemian nobles. In Bohemia, as in Italy
and in other countries, it was then the fashion that important
domestic events, such as marriages or deaths,
which occurred in noble families should be celebrated
in verse, and many poets, of whom Lomnick&yacute; was one,
obtained rich gifts from their patrons in remuneration
of verses of this description.</p>

<p>Lomnick&yacute; is also interesting as being the type of a
very numerous class of Bohemians&mdash;particularly of the
middle class&mdash;during the last years of independence.
Many Bohemians shared Lomnick&yacute;'s sensual and material
view of life, and his inability to feel any genuine political
or religious enthusiasms. This fact indeed convicts as
utter idealists, and therefore unpractical politicians, men
such as Harrant and Budova, who believed that their
countrymen were prepared to sacrifice their lives for a
Church similar to that of Geneva, and for a constitution
similar to that of Venice. Though perhaps only Lomnick&yacute;
welcomed in 1619 Frederick of the Palatinate, and
celebrated in 1621 the "just punishment" of his adherents,
yet the feeling of indifference to everything beyond
personal, mainly material, advantages which Lomnick&yacute;
so cynically displayed, was shared by many Bohemians
at the moment when they were confronted with the
most decisive crisis in their history.</p>

<p>Lomnick&yacute; is a voluminous writer, and, as already mentioned,
found it advantageous to be so. Besides the
numerous gifts which he received from the noble patrons
to whom he dedicated his works, he was also ennobled
by Rudolph II. in recognition of his poetical works. Of
his larger works, one of the earliest is his <i>Advice to a</i>
<i>Young Landowner</i> (or farmer), which has always been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the most popular of Lomnick&yacute;'s writings, and has in
recent times, since the revival of Bohemian literature,
been twice reprinted. The book is devoid of poetic
merit, but is curious as a study of the social life of
Bohemia. In the preface Lomnick&yacute; has explained the
purpose of the book, which is personified, and thus
addresses the reader: "God be with you, gentle reader&mdash;And
you in particular, young farmer.&mdash;I am again sent
out to you&mdash;If you will take me to yourself&mdash;We will
converse together&mdash;Rhyme together in Bohemian.&mdash;You
will, I am sure, say that I am right&mdash;And occasionally
even smile at my remarks&mdash;Through me you will learn&mdash;What
is beseeming for your household&mdash;You will not
require much patience&mdash;For I have but little to say&mdash;For
only to a moderate extent&mdash;And having regard to
brevity&mdash;Will I teach you husbandry&mdash;You may imagine
what I leave unsaid." The reader of this singular book
will sometimes regret that Lomnick&yacute; did not leave more
things unsaid.</p>

<p>Lomnick&yacute; begins his book by moralising on the inequalities
of fortune. He writes in the first chapter of
his book: "It is a well-known thing in the world&mdash;Both
in winter and in summer&mdash;Both when buying and when
selling&mdash;That no one always possesses happiness&mdash;With
one man everything succeeds&mdash;With another everything
goes amiss&mdash;In every sort of trade&mdash;One has gain, the
other loss.... Thus too with agriculture&mdash;As with
every other description of work&mdash;One is successful in
everything&mdash;With another everything is failure&mdash;One
man has a virtuous wife&mdash;Faithful, bashful, loving&mdash;Another
marries so slatternly a drab&mdash;That all food becomes
nauseous to him&mdash;One has obedient servants&mdash;Requiring
but little correction&mdash;Another may scold as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
much as he likes&mdash;Nothing will be better&mdash;His house
will be hell&mdash;They (=the servants) will take no notice
of him&mdash;Perhaps even laugh at him.&mdash;In your own
children too&mdash;You can see how different they are&mdash;Some
give pleasure&mdash;Others cause but grief." This
quotation is sufficient to prove that Lomnick&yacute; extended
his reflections far beyond the domain of agriculture. His
book contains chapters "on wisdom," "on enemies,"
"on ill-conducted old women," "on female servants and
their punishment," "on conjugal fidelity," "on dress,"
and on many other matters as little connected with his
subject.</p>

<p>Somewhat later Lomnick&yacute; published his <i>Cupid's</i>
<i>Arrow</i> (<i>Kupidova St&#345;ela</i>), a poem which contributed
greatly to his fame among his contemporaries. Though
the book was not, as has been frequently stated, dedicated
to Rudolph II., but to Lord William of Rosenberg, it found
great favour with the King of Bohemia, and probably
induced that prince to confer on Lomnick&yacute; the rank of
a noble, which he had long desired. In this book also
Lomnick&yacute; poses as a moralist, and inveighs against the
vices of his age. Bohemian authors, perhaps the only
ones who have seriously criticised Lomnick&yacute;'s writings,
have generally, and perhaps rightly, doubted whether
his virtuous indignation was sincere. Lomnick&yacute;, indeed,
in this very book, confesses that he was a "lover of
sweet Venus," and all his works&mdash;not even the <i>Advice</i>
<i>to a Landowner</i> excepted&mdash;show a predilection for <i>risqu&eacute;</i>
subjects and situations. Similar in tendency to the
<i>Arrow</i> is Lomnick&yacute;'s book entitled <i>Dance, a short treatise</i>
<i>on dancing, considered as an exaggerated exertion of</i>
<i>the luxurious body</i>, which was dedicated to his most
prominent patron, Lord Peter of Rosenberg. A con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>siderable
number of religious poems from the pen of
Lomnick&yacute; have also been preserved, mostly in MS. only.
They are written from the Roman Catholic standpoint,
which the author generally recognised, though he
seems at the time of the coronation of Frederick of the
Palatinate to have developed a sudden zeal for communion
in the two kinds.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that in my opinion the
minor works of Lomnick&yacute; possess far greater value than
his more extensive works. Of such poems the song in
celebration of the marriage of Joachim Ulrick, Lord of
Hradec, and the recently printed <i>Epithalamium</i> on the
marriage of William, Lord Stavata of Chlum, to the
noble Lady Lucy of Hradec, have great interest. The
last-named song contains a good deal of coarse wit,
and offensive allusions to members of the Bohemian
nobility who were present at the wedding. The recent
editor of this curious poem remarks, that on this occasion
the only remuneration which Lomnick&yacute; deserved from
his noble patrons was a sound thrashing! It must not,
however, be forgotten that Lomnick&yacute; held somewhat the
position of a licensed buffoon in the houses of the great
Bohemian nobles.</p>

<p>Very different from this and similar writings of Lomnick&yacute;
is the burial-song which he wrote on the occasion
of the death of his principal patron, Lord Peter Vok of
Rosenberg,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> in 1611, and which, it is said, he recited
when walking in the funeral procession. It is characteristic
of the enigmatic nature of Rosenberg that, though
perhaps not generally popular, he should yet have inspired
with a sincere feeling of affection not only men
such as B&#345;ezan, but even so thoroughly egotistical and unprincipled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>a time-server as Lomnick&yacute;. Yet no one who
reads this poem in its entirety can doubt that here, at
least, Lomnick&yacute; is thoroughly sincere. The poem loses
greatly by quotation; yet I shall translate a few lines
from a song that undoubtedly shows us Lomnick&yacute; at
his best. It begins thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>There was once in this Bohemian land a noble lord well known to all the people,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whose glory was great, whose name, Peter Vok of Rosenberg, was everywhere celebrated....</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He was as a shining light to this country, for which the race of Rosenberg will no longer shine.</i><a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The father of the fatherland is dead! No more, Bohemians, will you be able to lay on him the burden of power.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Already is he buried in the monastery of Vyssi Brod, which his ancestors erected and founded.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>At that monastery many noble lords assembled; much grief had they at this funeral.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>On Candlemas Day was he sorrowfully buried;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Let every one record the day</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>When death deprived us of this glorious lord; a great loss have we felt, a great grief has God inflicted on us.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>When seventy-two years of age he finished his earthly course, left this world.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Born at Krumlov, he died at Trebon; suddenly struck by illness, he saw the day of death.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In worthy old age he left this world; departed from earthly misery to eternal fame.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Somewhat later, Lomnick&yacute;, addressing the other
mourners, writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I, the founder of song, lament for him together with you, for my love drives me (to do so),</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Saying; 'My benefactor, too deeply for me do you sleep; but thou, the friend of the poor, knowest thy (heavenly) reward?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That I may yet serve his memory, I have written this short simple song.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Weeping has moistened my pen, more tears have I shed than any one who before me sang and wailed.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Bend your heads downward, dear friends; sprinkle with your tears the much-beloved rose.</i><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Pray faithfully for it to the Heavenly God, that it may blossom and grow for ever in His paradise.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the end of his poem Lomnick&yacute; reflects on the shortness
of human life, and alludes to the curious tradition,
that appears then to have been prevalent in Bohemia,
that the extinction of the house of Rosenberg would be
the prelude to great troubles and changes in Bohemia.
Lomnick&yacute; writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Our lifetime here becomes shorter; it perishes like a flower; we must betake ourselves hence into that other world.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Little time will pass till they carry us from our house; like a little leaf we fall from the tree.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But you, O Bohemian land, be careful of your fate, for all the words of Christ will be fulfilled;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Many wonders happen; the people murder one another; foul pestilences arise everywhere.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Frequently very noble lords leave us; the able and leading men disappear.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Thus this noble who lies on the bier, let him be an example to us; for we must remember</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That there is a prophecy that when this family is extinct there will be no peace in the Bohemian kingdom;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Indeed, that after the departure of this most glorious rose, things will go from bad to worse.</i><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Let no one be surprised that I dare to write thus, for this disorderly world cannot exist long.</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>We also must all die, must go to the distant land, taste death.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nothing remains but to prepare for it; however much a man may cry he must pay his penalty.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Let us then do penance, lead a virtuous life, if we wish to be with God.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Death and misery cannot harm us, for it (</i>i.e. <i>death) brings us from death to (eternal) life.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O Jesu Christ! Thou who art our highest Lord, when we die deign to be with us;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Receive our spirit in Thy most holy hand. Deliver us from Satan; do not let us go to torment;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rather deign to allow us to behold Thee with our eyes, and to meet Lord Peter again in heaven.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have already alluded to Lomnick&yacute;'s political rhymes,
which deserve some notice, though their poetic merit is
slight. Lomnick&yacute;'s rhythms have at least the merit that
they lose little by translation. When Frederick of the
Palatinate arrived in Bohemia in 1619, Lomnick&yacute;, with
his usual facility, immediately began singing the praise
of the new sovereign. His verses for a time obtained
great popularity at Prague, and&mdash;what was probably of
greater importance to the needy poet&mdash;he received a
considerable remuneration from the treasury of the
king. Some of these verses have been preserved in
the vast historical work of Sk&aacute;la ze Zho&#345;e.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> On the
arrival of Frederick, Lomnick&yacute; welcomed him with
these words: "O King Frederick&mdash;We entreat thee
with all our might&mdash;Drive the enemies from our land&mdash;Do
not let them rob us any more.&mdash;May God give you
His blessing&mdash;And grant you a happy reign&mdash;And also
a glorious victory&mdash;Over those who are our enemies&mdash;Then
may we have true freedom.&mdash;Receive in the two
kinds&mdash;The body and the blood of our Lord Jesus.&mdash;Do
thou effect this O King Frederick!&mdash;Confound the rebellious
ones (<i>i.e.</i> the Austrian party)&mdash;Then ever more
and more&mdash;Shall we praise you according to God&mdash;Celebrate
your dignity."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>Several other poems in the same sense, and dating
from about the same time&mdash;the end of the year 1619&mdash;have
been preserved. The battle of the White Mountain,
in the following year, produced an immediate
change in the views of the unscrupulous time-server
Lomnick&yacute;. He celebrated the executions at Prague on
June 21st, 1621, in a ballad, of which I shall quote a
few lines. The song begins thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>An evil beginning almost always has an evil end:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He that writes this song knows that this is no lie.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ill began the Calvinists, ill ended the Estates,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rebels all.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Yes, they roused up the whole world from vain pride, from wickedness;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They conspired together against his Highness</i> (i.e. <i>Ferdinand</i>).<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Having a king, their lord, already lawfully chosen</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And crowned,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They yet chose another for themselves, one of their band,</i><a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who was of the Calvinist faith, of that blind community;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They wanted to have superiority in everything, to be lords and freemen,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To insult the others.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After this not very veracious account of the origin of
the Bohemian troubles, Lomnick&yacute; refers to the details
of the executions. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Every one received punishment according to his offence.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He also did not remain without torment who had sinned with his tongue,</i><a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And, as the right demands, who had committed greater offence</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Had severer punishment.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Some were exiled for ever from the country;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Others in prison still hope for mercy;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Others, again, have been whipped: it is the fault of the rebels</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That this happens.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O most mournful spectacle! many were amazed,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Many a heart fainted, many shook from horror,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For there is no record that there ever occurred before</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>So great woe.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Twelve heads were placed on the bridge-gate,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That it might be proclaimed to every corner of the world</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who were the rebels, the wretched "directors,</i>"<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The cause of all evil.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The remains of those who were quartered were placed at the crossways in the streets;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The hands of some were chopped off, having those fingers</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Which had sworn falsely, which had been raised</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To promise faith.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song ends thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>O Jesus, we pray to Thee, listen to our voices.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Grant to us that we may shortly behold our beloved sovereign (Ferdinand II.).</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And, rejoicing with him, together praise and honour you,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Glorify you for ever.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>This story will be the wonder of the whole world,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And wherever the news reaches it will displease the evil-minded,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For no one before ever heard or read in the chronicles</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That the devil's pride was so greatly humiliated.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Many, many people then perished in a short time;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Their day was ended, they came to the term of their life.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O God! from a similar evil end</i><br /></span>

<p>Though severely reprimanded, Lomnick&yacute; himself escaped
punishment, perhaps in consequence of his speedy
recantation. The quaint tale that Lomnick&yacute; was summoned
to the presence of Ferdinand, reminded of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>benefits that he had received from Rudolph, the sovereign's
ancestor, that he had returned an impertinent
answer, and that Ferdinand had then ordered him to be
immediately whipped in his presence, has no historical
foundation. Lomnick&yacute;'s last years were spent in great
poverty. His former patrons, the great Bohemian nobles,
were either dead or were penniless exiles in distant
countries. The new Austrian authorities, whom he now
pestered with demands for pecuniary aid, took little
notice of Lomnick&yacute;. The year of his death is uncertain,
but was probably not later than the year 1623.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foundation of the community&mdash;or "Unity," as it
was generally called&mdash;of the Bohemian Brethren is of
the greatest importance for Bohemian literature as well
as for Bohemian history. It can be generally stated
that, with a few exceptions, all the men who, during the
last years of Bohemian independence, were most prominent
in literature and in politics belonged to the "Unity."
It is true that this is partly due to the fact that the
community soon mitigated its original extreme severity,
abandoned the views, derived from Chel&#269;icky, that all
participation in public life and all "worldly wisdom" is
forbidden to the true Christian. It thus became possible
that great nobles, politicians, and men of learning
should join the community. The foundation of the
Bohemian Unity, the consecration of the earliest priests,
and the exact tenets of the first members of the community,
are still very obscure, and even Dr. Goll, the
recognised authority on this subject, declares that many
points are doubtful.</p>

<p>The foundation of the Unity was undoubtedly an outcome
of the great religious convulsion in Bohemia that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
was caused by the death of Hus. The intellectual
originators, though not the actual founders, of the Unity
were Chel&#269;icky and Rokycan. It is difficult to do full
justice to Rokycan. His energy and courage were
indefatigable, and had it been possible to found in
Bohemia a Church agreeing mainly with the doctrine
of Rome, but not recognising the papal authority and
retaining its independence with regard to certain points
of ritual, Rokycan alone could perhaps have achieved
this object. It was a necessary consequence of Rokycan's
difficult position&mdash;he was Archbishop-elect of
Prague, but never recognised by the Papal See&mdash;that his
teaching somewhat differed at times in accordance with
the state of public affairs. When an agreement with
Rome seemed possible, his eloquent sermons dwelt
rather on the points in which the Utraquists agreed with
Rome. When, as always happened when the negotiations
with Rome had lasted some time, the Papal See
declared itself resolutely opposed to all the demands of
Bohemia, Rokycan preached strongly against the tenets
of Rome, and particularly against the avarice and immorality
of the Roman clergy. It is a peculiarity of the
Bohemian Church reformers that, from the days of Hus
to the time of the complete suppression of religious liberty,
they always laid great stress on this point.</p>

<p>During the reign of King Ladislas Posthumus (1439-1457),
who, in consequence of his early education, was
hostile to the Utraquist creed, then professed by the great
majority of the Bohemians, the preaching of Rokycan,
whom the king viewed with marked disfavour, was of
a very advanced character. Following directly in the
footsteps of Hus, Rokycan in his sermons strongly denounced
the corruption of the times and laid particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
stress upon the worthlessness of the Roman clergy.
Many of his remarks on this subject have been recorded
by the writers of the Unity. "A stag with golden
antlers on the bridge of Prague," he declared, "was
not so great a rarity as a good priest." These sermons
made a great impression on the vast audiences to whom
they were delivered; for the almost exclusive interest
in religious matters was then characteristic of most educated
Bohemians. Among the listeners who were most
impressed by Rokycan's fiery eloquence was a young
man known to us by the name of "Brother Gregory,"
who was destined to become the founder of the Unity.
Even after the careful researches of recent years, Gregory's
life is still surrounded by mystery. It is stated
that he was a nephew of Archbishop Rokycan, and also&mdash;what
renders that statement at least improbable&mdash;that
he belonged to a noble though poor family. His family
name, according to some accounts, was Krej&#269;i, which in
Bohemian signifies "tailor." It is, however, more probable
that he received that name because, after the foundation
of the Unity, he sometimes practised the trade
of a tailor. The strict rules established by Gregory himself
obliged the priests of the Unity to live in poverty
and by the work of their hands. In his earlier years
Gregory appears to have lived at a Utraquist monastery
at Prague, that had been founded by Magister P&#345;ibram.
It is, however, certain that he had not been ordained as
a priest.</p>

<p>Gregory, accompanied by some friends, visited the
Archbishop, and sought his advice on religious matters,
and specially on the subject of unworthy priests. To
understand the importance of this constantly-recurring
subject, it must be remembered that Hus, Chel&#269;icky, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
other Bohemian reformers denied all ecclesiastical powers
to unworthy priests, whom they considered as "not the
clergy of Christ, but of Antichrist." The Archbishop's
answer appears surprising, even if we consider that the
ever-varying relations between the Pope and the Church
of Bohemia were then at their worst. He advised his
visitors to study the works of Chel&#269;icky and to visit him.
Gregory followed this advice, and travelled to Chel&#269;ic,
where he visited Chel&#269;icky shortly before his death.
There is no doubt that the aged theologian's opinions
greatly influenced Gregory, and some of Chel&#269;icky's
adherents were no doubt among the first members of
the Unity.</p>

<p>The relations between Gregory and Rokycan did not
long continue friendly. After the death of King Ladislas,
George of Podebrad was elected King of Bohemia. The
new king endeavoured, at the beginning of his reign, to
obtain a reconciliation with Rome. He was ready to
conform to the Roman doctrine if that Church recognised
Rokycan as Archbishop of Prague, permitted
communion in the two kinds, and accepted that part
of the "Articles of Prague" which enjoined poverty on
the Bohemian clergy and opposed their notorious immorality.
While these negotiations were proceeding,
Rokycan advised Gregory and his friends to leave Prague
and to retire to a more secluded spot. He had obtained
permission from King George, who owned the estates
of Litic and Senftenberg in Eastern Bohemia, to allow
Gregory and his friends to settle in the secluded village
of Kunwald, near the small town of Senftenberg. It has
been stated by many historians, including Palack&yacute;, that
Rokycan had suggested this emigration to Gregory,
wishing to be rid of allies who had now become unwel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>come.
Dr. Goll has recently expressed his doubts as to
this conjecture. It is certain that no immediate and
complete rupture between Gregory and Rokycan took
place. Gregory arrived at Kunwald towards the end of
the year 1457, and was soon joined by many enthusiasts,
who desired to lead a simple life, according to the
customs of the primitive Christians. Among the early
disciples of Gregory was Michael, the parish priest of
Senftenberg, and another priest named Matthew. After
the death of Chel&#269;icky, some of the "Brothers of Chel&#269;ic"<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
also joined the community of Kunwald, as did some
of the remaining Taborites, and probably, though this
point is doubtful, some Austrian Waldenses also.</p>

<p>The new community soon became obnoxious to the
Government of King George, and the "first persecution,"
as it is termed in the writings of the Unity, began in 1460.
Some of the fanatics, known at that period all over
Europe as the "Pickharts" or "Beghards," had about
that time joined the community of Kunwald, and drew
on it the indignation of the Bohemian authorities. In
1461 Gregory returned for a short time to Prague. It
has been suggested that he did this in opposition to a
promise made to Rokycan; but of this there is no sufficient
proof. At Prague Gregory held secret meetings of
his adherents, among whom were a considerable number
of students of the university. Gregory received notice&mdash;perhaps
from Rokycan himself&mdash;that these gatherings
were being watched. He therefore, at a meeting on
March 15th, begged all present to disperse immediately.
Some did so, but others declared that they were doing
no wrong; and when Gregory drew their attention to the
fact that they were risking imprisonment, and even torture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>they answered, "Well, we will have torture for
breakfast, and the funeral pile for dinner." The Government
officials shortly afterwards arrested the remaining
members of the assembly, and several underwent the
torture of the rack. Not all displayed fortitude; several,
as a member of the Unity, writing shortly after these
events took place, quaintly expresses it, "having breakfasted,
did not wait for dinner." Those who dreaded
further punishment were obliged to pronounce a solemn
recantation in the presence of Rokycan.</p>

<p>Whether Gregory himself underwent torture is uncertain,
though most of the writers of the Unity, from
Brother Lucas to Brother Jaffet, state it is a fact.
Brother Jaffet<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> tells us that Gregory "was tied to a post,
placed on the rack, and burnt. Weakened by long fasting,
he then fainted, and no longer felt pain; only when
he had been released he felt his side, and understood what
had been done to him." Rokycan visited Gregory in
prison, and, to use Brother Jaffet's words, condoled with
him with the "compassion of a crocodile." Seeing the
traces of his sufferings, he exclaimed, "Dear Gregory,
how I pity you. Remember that I always told you if
you pursued your endeavours you would suffer and it
would fare badly with you."</p>

<p>Dr. Goll has recently expressed doubts whether torture
was inflicted on Brother Gregory, though he admits
that his followers were tortured. There is, however, no
doubt that the tradition of the sufferings of Brother
Gregory, the founder of the Unity, can be traced back to
the earliest records of the community. It is, therefore,
difficult to believe that the traditional account is a mere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>fiction. Of modern writers Palack&yacute; and Jire&#269;ek maintain
the truth of the ancient record of the Unity. What
is, however, certain is that Rokycan's part in these
events has been misrepresented. Political reasons at that
moment rendered it advisable for King George to appear
as the enemy of the extreme antagonists of Rome.
Rokycan's influence on the king was then very slight,
but such as it was, it induced George after a time to
liberate Brother Gregory from prison.</p>

<p>Difficulties had meanwhile arisen in the small community,
of which first Kunwald and then the neighbouring
small town of Reichenau (Rychnov) on the Kn&#283;&#382;na
was the centre. Gregory was indeed the intellectual
leader as well as the founder of the community, but
the priests Michael and Martin seem, probably in
consequence of their having been ordained as priests,
to have claimed a certain superiority over the other
brethren. To obviate these difficulties, Gregory resorted
to what must then have appeared a most venturesome
step. He decided that his followers should, in
accordance with the example of the Apostles, elect
priests from among their number. The doctrine of the
necessity of the apostolic derivation of the clergy was
then held even by sects that were strongly opposed to
Rome. This is no doubt the reason why, according to
most accounts, the new priests were subsequently consecrated
by a Waldensian priest or bishop. It must be
added that the part played by the Waldensian in the
first ordination of the clergy of the Unity becomes much
more prominent in the works of later writers than it
was in those of contemporaries. Dr. Lechler has recently
expressed doubts as to whether the intervention
of a Waldensian at the first ordination that took place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
in the Unity is a historical fact. Such an intervention
appears to him to be in contradiction with the previous
decision of the brethren to elect priests on the strength
of divine inspiration. It must, however, be noticed that
in Brother Gregory's account of the ceremony, written
in Bohemian, and therefore perhaps unknown to Dr.
Lechler, who was a German, the Waldensian priest is
already mentioned. The point, like many others connected
with the origin of the Unity, will perhaps never
be settled. It has given rise to an extensive controversial
literature.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>A meeting of the brethren of the Unity took place at
Lhotka, a small village near Reichenau, in 1467. I will
quote a portion of Gregory's account of the proceedings
to which I have just referred. Gregory's Bohemian is
very rugged and lends itself but little to translation.
Following the example of Dr. Goll, who has translated
a large part of the account contained in Gregory's
<i>Fourth Letter to Rokycan</i> into German, I give a nearly
literal translation. It would be easy to smooth down
Gregory's style, but at the risk of not conveying the
exact meaning. He writes: "Among us some doubt
and irresolution sprung up. We therefore conformed
in everything to the Acts of the Apostles and the
example of the first saints, wishing to act in everything
in the name of God both in word and deed.
Therefore, trusting to His promises contained in the
words, 'Whatsoever you will ask of the Father in My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>name, He will grant you,' and again, 'Whenever two or
three are gathered together,' and so forth, we deliberated
as to whether God wished that we should separate entirely
from the jurisdiction of the Pope and of his priesthood,
and secondly, whether God wished that we should
establish a separate organisation on the model of the
Primitive Church. We further deliberated as to what
persons should arbitrate in disputes and have such
authority that all should maintain peace and submit to
their verdict. And further, who should serve and who
obtain the first places and possess the power of office,
according to the words, 'To you I give the keys,' and
again, 'Whom you forgive their sins.'</p>

<p>"And we, many of us from Bohemia and other lands,
decided to pray to God, should He then wish it (<i>i.e.</i> that
they should establish a separate organisation), that He
might give us a sign, according to the example of the
Apostles when they chose a twelfth. And we ordered all
brothers in the different districts to pray and fast in view
of this. Then we assembled in numbers and prayed to
the Lord God that He might give us a sign whether He
then wished this or not. And it so happened that He
did wish it, and we had the faith that it was God's will
that it should happen thus.... And when the day
came, many of us again assembled from Bohemia and
Moravia, and we prayed to God with the same confidence
as before, and we chose nine men, of whom three,
or two, or one were to be it (<i>i.e.</i> the head of the new
Church). But if God had not wished it that year, then
no one would have been chosen. We should have remained
without priests till God, in consequence of our
prayers and of our faith, had shown us that He wished
it, and also what persons should be chosen. But as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
had abandoned the priests who derive their power from
the papal office, firmly believing that God did not desire
that we should heed them in regard to our obedience
(=obey them), therefore we firmly believed that God
would grant us what we prayed for. And the Lord did
so, because of our faith and our prayers, and ordained
that it (the choice) should fall on all three.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> And God
thus manifested His wisdom and power to us in such a
manner that we all felt clearly that God had visited us,
and had done great things to confirm us in the faith.
More than sixty brethren were assembled, and with full
confidence and joy we received the Holy Ghost, and
thanked God that He had visited us at the end of days
and done His work.</p>

<p>"We then conversed together on the confirmation of
their priestly office (<i>i.e.</i> that of the three who had been
chosen as priests), how it could be done in the most
seemly manner and without offence to the people;
though we believed without doubt that they were already
ordained and confirmed by our Lord Christ, as God
had shown us. But we wished to appear righteous, not
only before God, but also as far as possible before all
men. Therefore we sought it (<i>i.e.</i> confirmation) from
one (priest) whom we had received from the Romans,
and from another who belonged to the Waldenses, who
spring from the primitive Church, a man of whom we
were confident that he was in the state of grace. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>we took these two for the ordination of the three. If
God wishes it so, we said, let Him show it. And we
prayed to God that He might, should He desire this
confirmation by the Waldensian, give such grace to that
elder that he might do it from love and in true faith.</p>

<p>"And God gave it (grace) to him, that he did it in true
faith; and, encouraging us, he spoke good words and
praised God, saying, 'God has done this for the benefit
of our salvation.' And then he confirmed these three
in their priestly office by laying his hands on them and
by prayers, according to the example of the primitive
Church and the instructions of the Apostles. And as
regards Jesus's having from on high pointed out the
three that were chosen, and the one of them who was
to have highest rank, he to whom it had been disclosed
(perhaps Gregory himself) said, 'Believe firmly that this
is so.'"</p>

<p>Though the later members of the Unity studied the art
of literary composition, and indeed attained mastership
in it, this was not the case with Brother Gregory. His
writing shows that he was entirely absorbed in his
endeavour to place his religious views before his former
friend and present antagonist, Rokycan, to whom the
letter is addressed. It has been very difficult to render
Gregory's words clearly without entirely altering his
manner of writing. The passage quoted above, and
indeed the whole <i>Fourth Letter to Rokycan</i>, is, however,
worthy of notice. It is the only account by an
eye-witness of the meeting at Lhotka, which marks the
beginning of the Unity, and was written by Brother
Gregory in 1468, only a year after the assembly.</p>

<p>The consequence of the meeting at Lhotka was a
renewed persecution of the members of the Unity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Rokycan published a very severe edict against them,
for their attempt to establish an independent clergy was
as obnoxious to the Utraquist as to the Roman priests.
Brother Gregory lived for seven years after the assembly
at Lhotka, and as he is stated to have been over fifty
when the community of Kunwald was founded in 1457,
he must have attained a considerable age. His entire
energy and activity were to the last devoted to the Unity.
Its constitution, which conferred the principal power on
the so-called smaller<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> council, at whose head was a president
("ordinator"), often, though not in the fifteenth
century, called "bishop," is the work of Gregory.
Though in every respect the leading spirit of the Unity,
Gregory never aspired to be the recognised leader of his
Church. That rank was from the time of the meeting
of Lhotka assumed by the priest Matthew, who at the
time of that meeting was a young man of the age of
twenty-five. Whether the fact that Matthew had been
ordained as a priest by the Church of Rome was not
one of the causes of his election, cannot perhaps now
be ascertained. The remarks of Gregory, quoted above,
seem to be in opposition to this view. Matthew was on
terms of friendship with Brother Gregory, and accepted
his guidance on all matters of doctrine and discipline.
He is described as a man of weak character, and the
discord that broke out among the brethren after the
death of Gregory seems to confirm this view.</p>

<p>The small town of Brandeis on the Adler,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> situated in
the picturesque valley of the Orlice or Adler, was one of
the early centres of the community of the brethren, and
it was here that Brother Gregory spent the greater part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>of his last years. He continued, however, to the end of
his life to pay frequent visits to other communities of the
brethren. Brother Gregory died at Brandeis on August
12, 1474, and was buried, "like the prophets of the Old
Testament, in a rock-grave near the bank of the Orlice,
that is, opposite the castle." Gregory, the patriarch of
the Unity, as he called himself in his later years, was
certainly one of its greatest men. He combined the
most fervent religious enthusiasm with the talents of a
clear-headed and indefatigable organiser; and though
changes took place in the institutions of the Unity after
his death, yet on the whole the structure erected by
Gregory continued to exist till the time when the battle
of the White Mountain destroyed all communities that
were opposed to Rome.</p>

<p>Dr. Goll, who has given a masterly sketch of the career
of Gregory, thus describes him:<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> "Gregory had created
for himself the ideal image of a true Christian, an abstemious,
kindly, patient, gracious, merciful, economical,
pure, humble-minded, peaceful, worthy, zealous, yielding,
compliant man, qualified and ready to do all good works.
But this model was not for Gregory a model only. He
believed that Christians can come near to the model, nay,
even attain it. 'We believe this,' he writes in the <i>Fourth</i>
<i>Letter to Rokycan</i>, 'that he who has God's true and living
faith has the power also to mortify the evil in himself
and to act righteously; his faith by means of love will
induce him to do what is pleasing to God, good actions
and such as are useful to his fellow-creatures.... Though
by nature hasty and irritable, a true Christian must be
abstemious, meek, and silent. A model for this model is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>found in our Saviour Himself. He suffered for us and
gave us an example in His acts, accomplishing the work
that His Father had laid upon Him. A true Christian
must take on himself those burdens which were Christ's
also; he must endure adverse things and injuries affecting
his estate, his honour, and his life quietly, considering
that it must be thus.'"</p>

<p>After reading Dr. Goll's definition of the doctrine of
Brother Gregory it is scarcely necessary to state that
theological controversy plays a very small part in Gregory's
writings. The imitation of Christ was the purpose
of his life and is the leading motive of his writings.
Readers of the portions of the <i>Fourth Letter to Rokycan</i>
which I have already quoted will have noticed how little
importance Gregory himself appears to attach to the
confirmation of the priests; it was sufficient for him
firmly to believe that the choice had been made in
accordance with God's own command.</p>

<p>The literary remains of Gregory, all written in Bohemian,
are considerable. There are seven so-called <i>Letters</i>
<i>to Rokycan</i>, which, though they were all undoubtedly sent
to the Archbishop, were yet intended for a wider circle
of readers. Two of these letters, the fourth, from which
I have quoted extensively, and the sixth, were afterwards
republished by Gregory in an enlarged form, the former
under the title of <i>The Sufferings of the Brethren under King</i>
<i>George</i>, the latter under that of <i>The Answer of the Ancient</i>
<i>Brethren</i>. We have letters also addressed to other people.
The form of a letter was then a very favourite one for expounding
theological views. Other writings of Gregory
are <i>The Book on Good and Evil Priests</i>, <i>On the Holy</i>
<i>Church</i>, and <i>On the Narrow Path</i>. A treatise, evidently
dating from the first days of the Unity, and entitled <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span><i>How</i>
<i>People should Behave with regard to the Roman Church</i>, is
also generally attributed to Gregory. Recent research
renders it probable that it is not his work.</p>

<p>It is, of course, out of place to give here an historical
account of the development of the Unity, though
such a work would have great interest. The brethren
were, however, such indefatigable writers that it is
necessary frequently to refer to the history of the community.</p>

<p>Discord broke out among the brethren, who had
already become numerous, shortly after the death of
Gregory, probably about the year 1480. Matthew, who
had been the nominal head of the community during
Gregory's lifetime, appears to have been a well-meaning
man of weak character, who became helpless after the
loss of his sagacious adviser. Several different causes of
discord are mentioned as appearing at about the same
time. A theological controversy as to the means of
salvation was indeed settled by means of a compromise
proposed at one of the numerous meetings of the
brethren by Brother Prokop, noticeable also as one of
the theological writers of the Unity. Shortly afterwards,
however, discussions as to "worldly power" led to a
rupture. Gregory had, on the whole, held the opinions
of Chel&#269;icky,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> according to which no true Christian
should take part in the government of the State, nor
should he take oaths or possess worldly goods. Gregory
also shared Chel&#269;icky's dislike to towns, "the foundations
of Cain." These views had been strictly carried
out during the first years of the Unity. The new members
had, on joining the community, been obliged to
despoil themselves of all worldly possessions and conform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>to the other doctrines of Chel&#269;icky mentioned
above.</p>

<p>In the last years of the fifteenth century men of higher
rank, townsmen and nobles, of whom Kostka of Postupic
was the first, began to join the community. It now
became more difficult to maintain the early regulations
in their entire severity. Some of the brethren complained
that they incurred persecution on the part of
their fellow-citizens because they had refused to hold
municipal offices or to appear as witnesses in the law-courts.
Two parties soon formed themselves in the
Unity. One, known as the "large party," was in favour
of somewhat relaxing the rigour of the original regulations;
this was evidently necessary if the community
was to expand and to acquire the protection of some of
the nobles, without which it could hardly have continued
to exist long in Bohemia. The other party, known as
the "small party," adhered strictly to the original regulations.
Many attempts at a reconciliation were made,
and frequent meetings of the elders of the Unity took
place for this purpose, generally at Reichenau on the
Kn&#283;&#382;na, or at Brandeis on the Orlice. A last effort
of reconciliation was made in 1496, when numerous
members of both parties met at Chlumec. Here, as at
the previous conferences, both parties maintained their
previous views, and the discussion only proved that the
standpoints were entirely different and an agreement
impossible. Though even after this attempts at mediation
were made, the "small party," led by Brother Amos,
now seceded from the main body of the community,
and after a few years it entirely disappears. The "large
party," on the other hand, freed from the original exaggerated
regulations, obtained great and deserved fame in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Bohemia; it became the cradle of almost all those who,
in the last century of Bohemian independence, were
prominent as statesmen or authors.</p>

<p>Among the early writers of the "large party," <span class="smcap">Prokop</span>
<span class="smcap">of Neuhaus</span> or Jind&#345;ichuv Hradec deserves mention,
though his fame has been obscured by the greater
name of his successor, Brother Lucas, who finally
secured the victory of the "large party." Prokop
appears to have been one of the original members
of the community of Kunwald. When the controversy
as to the means of salvation sprung up among the
brethren, Prokop, as already mentioned, succeeded in
inducing the contending parties to accept a compromise.
When the discussion whether the brethren were
entitled to possess worldly property and to hold state
offices began, Prokop expressed views which, though
they were not quite in accordance with either party,
really prove him an adherent of the "large party." It
was on this subject that Prokop wrote his <i>Explanation</i>
<i>of the Fifth Chapter of St. Matthew</i>. He here writes
that, "though difficult, it is admissible that nobles and
mighty men should be received into the Unity and be
considered members of it, if they avoid deadly sins, for
which poor men also go to hell, and if in all important
matters they conform to Christianity and lead a Christian
life." Prokop continues to state "that, speaking
generally, the brethren may exercise the duties of town-councillors
and of other offices, and that they may
appeal to the temporal power for aid; for this is for
the general good."</p>

<p>It will be seen by this quotation that Prokop generally
agreed with the views of the "large party," though
he sometimes differed from Brother Lucas, with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
he was indeed several times engaged in controversies.
Prokop was the principal orator of the "large party"
at the meetings at Reichenau in 1494 and at Chlumec
in 1496. He was then, as Blahoslav tells us, "the foremost
man of the Unity." Prokop spent the greatest
part of his life at Brandeis, and died there in 1507.
He has left a considerable number of works, all written
in Bohemian. Besides the <i>Explanation of the Fifth</i>
<i>Chapter of St. Matthew</i>, which has already been mentioned,
he wrote <i>Five Letters to Brother Lucas on his</i>
<i>(Lucas's) work entitled 'The Bark,'</i> and the <i>Book against</i>
<i>Antichrist</i>.</p>

<p>Better known than Prokop is Brother Lucas, the
foremost representative of the "large party" during
its struggle; he is yet more noteworthy as the man
who after its victory reorganised the Unity, and, to a
certain extent, altered its institutions in a more enlightened
and liberal manner. The works of Lucas,
all written in Bohemian, are numerous; he is indeed,
next to Komensk&yacute;, the most voluminous writer of the
Unity. Lucas, generally known as <span class="smcap">Lucas of Prague</span>,
was born about the year 1460. He was greatly impressed
by the writings of the early members of the
Unity, and, together with his friend the young nobleman
Lawrence of Krasonick&yacute;, he joined the community
about the year 1482. He soon attained a prominent
position among the brethren, and in 1490 was already
a member of the "smaller council." When the differences
of the Unity between the "large" and the "small"
party arose, Lucas declared himself energetically in
favour of the former, and was indeed one of its representatives
at several assemblies. The discord among
the brethren, and the religious uncertainty which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
one of its results, seems to have rendered yet stronger
the desire for a return to the primitive Church, which,
sometimes more obvious, sometimes scarcely perceptible,
can yet be traced in the writings of all Bohemian
reformers. Some of the brethren maintained that in
distant Eastern lands Christians yet existed who had
retained the purity of the primitive Church, both as
regards doctrine and the conduct of life. The Unity
decided to send out several brethren, who were to
discover these communities which entirely conformed
with the primitive Church. Lucas, with two companions,
started for this purpose for Constantinople, where
they separated. Lucas himself appears to have visited
Mount Athos and the communities of the Bulgarians,
and of the Bohomils in Bosnia. Fertile writer though
he was, Lucas has unfortunately left us no account of
his travels, for which we could well have spared one
or two of his sixty-eight theological works. The first
of these works, entitled <i>The Bark</i>, was written shortly
after his return from his journey. As already mentioned,
it involved him in a controversy with Brother
Prokop.</p>

<p>After the assembly of Chlumec and the final victory
of the more enlightened party among the brethren, it
was resolved to reorganise the community, and to model
their institutions to a certain extent on those of the
Waldenses. The exact relations between the two communities
will perhaps never be known, particularly as
the history of the Waldenses or Vaudois is itself very
obscure. It is, however, certain that the brethren were
fully conscious of an affinity between themselves and
the older community. Lucas was intrusted with the
mission of visiting the Waldensian communities, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
started for Italy and Savoy accompanied by Brother
Tuma of Landskron, known as "N&#283;mec" (or the
German). Among the places they visited was Florence,
where they were present at the death of Savonarola
(May 23, 1498). Of this journey also Lucas has left
us no account. On his return to Bohemia, Brother
Lucas obtained a yet more important position in his
community. After the death of Matthew an assembly
of the brethren which met at Reichenau in 1500 decided
to elect several bishops. Lucas was one of those
chosen, and appears to have exercised greater influence
than his colleagues. The Roman Catholic monk Wolfgang,
with whom Lucas engaged in one of his many
theological controversies, indeed describes him as "the
anti-pope."</p>

<p>During the persecution which again befell the Unity
at the beginning of the sixteenth century Lucas displayed
admirable courage and energy. Rightly believing
that ignorance was the cause of many of the attacks
on the brethren, he was indefatigable in expounding
their real teaching. He wrote an appeal to the king
and a letter to the people of Bohemia, protesting against
the judgment of those who had declared that the
brethren were "worse than Jews and heathens, indeed
equal to devils," Lucas also appealed to Erasmus of
Rotterdam against the ignorant misjudgment which
resulted in so much suffering for the brethren. He
despatched two members of the community to Erasmus
as bearers of a written "confession" or "apology" of
the Unity. Erasmus, with characteristic prudence, declined
to be entangled in the controversy.</p>

<p>About the year 1514 the attitude of the Bohemian
officials became less hostile to the Unity. Contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
records give no reason for this change; but Blahoslav's
statement that "the king investigated the doctrine of
the Unity and decided in its favour" is most improbable.
The influence of some powerful noblemen who
had joined the brethren probably secured for the Unity
what was really only the tacit toleration of its existence.
The fiction that only the Utraquist Church, which
was the "State Church," and the Roman creed were
recognised in Bohemia was maintained up to a far
later date. The last years of the eventful life of Lucas
were influenced by the appearance of Luther. Luther's
teaching soon became known in Bohemia, and was
welcomed by the people of that country. They felt as
if their isolation, which had long weighed on them, was
ended when even the Germans, the mortal enemies of
Utraquism, communicated in the two kinds. The more
advanced Utraquists specially sympathised with German
Protestantism, and it did not for a moment seem impossible
that Bohemia should adopt the teaching of
Luther. The brethren, and Brother Lucas in particular,
however, declared that they should always maintain
their own community distinct from both the German Protestants
and the Bohemian Utraquists. They have often
been praised for this, but it is very probable that by
joining the German Protestants the Bohemians would
have obtained powerful allies when, at the beginning
of the seventeenth century, the Jesuit reaction attacked
their country. The isolation in which the Bohemian
brethren, and to a lesser extent the Bohemian Utraquists,
continued, alone accounts for the incredible apathy
with which the German Protestants viewed the suppression
of Protestantism in Bohemia. At the negotiations
which preceded the Treaty of Westphalia, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Swedish envoys alone made an ineffective appeal in
favour of the Unity and the other non-Roman inhabitants
of Bohemia.</p>

<p>In a treatise published in 1522 Lucas attacked Luther's
teaching on several points, but on receiving a conciliatory
answer from the great German reformer he decided
on entering into negotiations with him. He sent
a member of the Unity, Brother Roh<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> or Horn, to
Wittenberg with copies of several of his works. Luther
does not seem to have had a very clear idea of the
identity of the community which wished to enter into
relations with him, for he addressed his answer to "his
dear nobles and friends the brethren called Waldenses
living in Bohemia and Moravia." The contents of the
letter appear to have displeased Lucas, who wrote
several treatises for the purpose of "strengthening"
the brethren against the teaching of Luther. Lucas,
indeed, somewhat later sent a second messenger to
Wittenberg, but the disagreement continued, and subsequently
a complete rupture took place. To the end
of his life Lucas continued to labour at the reorganisation
of the Unity. One of his latest and most important
works was his <i>Zpr&aacute;va Kn&#283;&#382;ka</i> ("Instruction for the
Clergy of the Unity"), published in 1526; he died two
years later.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that Brother Lucas
was a voluminous writer. Dr. Jire&#269;ek in his biography
published in 1875 enumerates sixty-eight works of Lucas,
some of which, it is true, are known only by repute and
have not been preserved. Since the appearance of Dr.
Jire&#269;ek's book, Dr. Goll has discovered works of Lucas
that are not included in his list. Among the works of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>Brother Lucas known now only by name but enumerated
in Dr. Jire&#269;ek's list is an "Answer to the ten articles of
Master Jerome Dungesham<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> of Oxford, (written) against
the apology of the Brethren published in 1514." The
first work of Lucas, was as already mentioned, his
<i>Barka</i> or "Bark." This work too was believed to be
lost, but within the last years Dr. Goll has discovered
a MS. which contains this once celebrated work of Lucas.
The allegorical name of the book is thus explained by
the author. He tells us that in the first part of his
work the bark signifies the Unity, and that it is his
purpose to explain out of what planks it is constructed,
what are its requirements, who is its captain and guide,
and what is the destination of its course. In this first
part of the work the captain is Jesus Christ. The second
division of the book deals with "The Bark of Antichrist,"
with the foolish and misguided people who occupy it,
and with the weighty reasons for flying from that bark,
the course of which leads to perdition. Like so many
Bohemian works of this period, the "Bark" treats
mainly of Antichrist. It is interesting as being very
similar, and in parts identical, with one of the ancient
books of the Waldenses. It undoubtedly throws some
light on the obscure question of the relations between
the Bohemian brethren and the older community.</p>

<p>Of the many other works of Lucas I shall be able to
notice even briefly but very few. The two <i>Professions</i>
<i>of the Faith of the Unity</i>, addressed to King Vladislav,
and similar documents addressed to Erasmus and Luther,
have been already mentioned. Very curious is Lucas's
work entitled <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span><i>The Revival of the Holy Church, and the</i>
<i>reasons which render it certain that such a revival has</i>
<i>taken place in the shape of the Unity</i>. Lucas draws a
curious mystic parallel between the life of Christ and
the development of the Unity. He also refers to the
simplicity of the primitive Church, and to the gradual
increase of the power of the Bishops of Rome. In distinction
from his predecessors, Lucas no longer believes
in the "donation of Constantine." He only tells us that
Constantine placed the Bishop of Rome before all other
bishops. "Constantine," Lucas tells us, "seated Sylvester
on a white horse. This appeared wonderful to
the people, and in their Latin or Italian speech they
exclaimed, 'Pape! Pape!'<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> that is, 'What a great, great
wonder!'" Only Charles the Great, Lucas tells us, added
temporal power to the ecclesiastical supremacy. It is
particularly noticeable that in this book also Lucas does
not allude to his travels, though on several occasions it
would have been natural to do so. It is almost certain
that this silence is intentional. Dr. Goll has, with great
sagacity, suggested its cause. The brethren now believed
that the true primitive Church had been revived
in their own community, and did not wish to recall the
fact that they had formerly sought for it elsewhere.</p>

<p>The polemical works of Lucas are very numerous, and
are directed indifferently against all those who did not
accept the doctrine of the Unity as expounded by him.
His controversies with Luther have already been mentioned.
A work of Lucas's is directed against Zwingli,
whose teaching had also penetrated into Bohemia. He
also engaged in a theological controversy with "Wolfgang,
the barefooted friar." Wolfgang, one of the
earlier champions of the Church of Rome, played a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>curious part in the great theological controversy that
absorbed almost the whole intellectual activity of Bohemia
during two centuries. I shall again refer to him.
Another controversial book of Lucas's directed against
Brother Kalenec, a member of the "small party" in the
Unity, is interesting as containing the author's opinion
on Chel&#269;icky, whose memory was naturally very popular
with the smaller and more retrograde fraction of the
Unity. Lucas writes: "You take refuge with Peter of
Chel&#269;ic, and recommend to others his books, such as
the <i>Net of Faith</i>. I, who have read and copied out
many of his books before I joined the brethren, will
say that in many matters he thought wrongly, and in a
manner contrary to Scripture, and that he wrote obscurely
and without moderation. I have also heard
from those brethren that were with him much that was
not praiseworthy, particularly that he was very irritable
and vindictive. Thus, having fallen out with a priest,
he would not forgive him till his death; so that priest
himself told me. And he (Chel&#269;icky) unjustly defamed
the Taborite priests, particularly as regards their teaching
on the sacrament."</p>

<p>A year before his death, Brother Lucas again returned
to his favourite subject, the identification of the Unity
with the primitive Church, in his treatise <i>On the Origin of</i>
<i>the Unity</i>. Dealing with the manner in which the consciousness
of the corruption of the Church reached
Bohemia, Lucas writes: "The movement began through
the Waldenses in England, where Wycliffe was the
king's chaplain, but only read mass. And a Waldensian
with whom he was acquainted said to him that he only
fulfilled half the duty of his office, because he did not
preach; and he proved this from Scripture.... Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
of those who at that time (in England) suffered much
adversity and martyrdom, some went to other countries,
and particularly to Dresden, and thence some of them
afterwards proceeded to Bohemia," Though unhistorical,
this account is curious as containing what was
probably a very old tradition. Lucas here, as was frequently
the case with Bohemian writers of his time,
describes as "Waldenses" all early opponents of the
Church of Rome.</p>

<p>Brother Lucas was certainly one of the greatest men
of the Unity, probably the greatest theologian whom the
community produced. It was principally through the
reorganisation of the community, that is his work, that
the brethren were able to play a considerable part in
Bohemian history. It is, however, an exaggeration to
consider Lucas as a "second founder" of the Unity.
The main lines of Brother Gregory's great structure
remained. Of Lucas as an author, Brother Blahoslav<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
writes as follows: "Brother Lucas wrote a great many
books, but he was not a very good Bohemian (writer);
he imitated Latin more than is befitting, and his knowledge
of German was also harmful to him, for his family
came from a place where much German was spoken.
'In summe Latinismos et Germanismos plurrimos admittere
solebat.'<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Therefore, and also for another reason,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
his works appeared to many not clear and displeasing."</p>

<p>In connection with Lucas I shall briefly refer to his
associate Krasonick&yacute;. Krasonick&yacute; was, like Lucas, an
adherent of the "large party." He appears to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>been a fertile writer, but many of his works are known
only by name. Among those that have been preserved
is a treatise addressed to Brother Amos, the leader of the
"small party." Another work of Krasonick&yacute;, recently
discovered by Dr. Goll in the town-library of G&ouml;rlitz,
is addressed to Cahera, then administrator of the Utraquist
consistory. Its subject is the sacrament, a question
on which so large a part of the theological controversy
of the period revolved. Krasonick&yacute;'s treatise, however,
goes far beyond the immediate limits of his subject. Of
the foundation of the Unity he gives an account that is
far more detailed than that of Brother Gregory, from
which I have quoted, though it does not contain many
facts that are found in the writings of yet later writers.
Krasonick&yacute; also refers to the then all-important question
of apostolic succession, the existence of which he
altogether denies. Even should it yet exist, he writes, it
certainly cannot be found within the Church of Rome.
Like Brother Lucas, Krasonick&yacute; maintains that St. Peter
never visited Rome. When referring to those who had
borne witness to the corruption of the Roman Church,
he mentions "Dr. Jerome Savonarola." He writes of
him: "The works that he composed, his letters to the
emperor and others, prove what his opinions were. Half
the city mourned over him when the Pope first caused
him to be tortured, then publicly proclaimed what
torture had forced him to confess, and at last caused
him on the public square of Florence to be first hanged
on a cross with two companions, and then to be burnt."
Dr. Goll is, no doubt, right in conjecturing that this
accurate account of the death of Savonarola is derived
from Brother Lucas, who was an eye-witness of that
event. Other existent theological works of this period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
are ascribed both to Krasonick&yacute; and to Prokop, who has
already been mentioned. Blahoslav describes Krasonick&yacute;
as "a sensible and learned man, a friend of ancient
simplicity." Even in Blahoslav's days many of Krasonick&yacute;'s
works had already been lost.</p>

<p>Of the writers of the "small party" it will be sufficient
to mention Brother Amos, its first leader. He is known
to have written three theological treatises, one of which
has been partly preserved in a work of Brother Lucas,
written for the purpose of refuting it. Amos, like Krasonick&yacute;
and the majority of the writers of the Unity,
wrote only in Bohemian.</p>

<p>The life of Bishop <span class="smcap">Augusta</span> (born 1500, died 1572)
belongs, like that of Archbishop Rokycan, rather to the
political history of Bohemia than to literature. Though
his fame as a preacher is far greater than as a writer,
he was the author of a large number of theological
works. Born in humble circumstances&mdash;his father was
a hatter&mdash;and not having received a very extensive
education, Augusta's talents, and yet more his indomitable
energy and determination, soon brought him to
the fore. Born a member of the Utraquist Church, he
joined the Unity at the age of twenty-four. He was prepared
for his clerical duties by Brother Lucas, and in
1532 became one of the elders&mdash;or bishops, as they were
often called&mdash;to whom the entire government of the
Unity was intrusted. His influence soon became predominant
among the brethren. While Brother Lucas
and Augusta's younger contemporary, Blahoslav, wished
above all to preserve the separate character of the
Unity, Augusta was in favour of a close alliance, if not
of a union, with Luther and the German Protestants.
Augusta, for this purpose, twice visited the great German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
reformer at Wittenberg, and also had, in 1546, an interview
with the Protestant Elector of Saxony. In the
following year war broke out in Germany between the
Emperor Charles V. and the German Protestants, whose
leaders were the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave
of Hesse.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> After the defeat of the Protestants at the
battle of M&uuml;hlberg, Charles's brother, Ferdinand, King
of Bohemia, dealt severely with their Bohemian sympathisers.
Augusta was arrested and imprisoned for a long
time in the castle of P&uuml;rglitz or K&#345;ivoklat. His companion,
the young priest Bilek, has left us a very interesting
account of Augusta's prison life.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>During the whole term of his imprisonment, which
only ended in 1564, Augusta maintained his claim to the
leadership of the Unity. When the only other bishop
died, the brethren, who had established secret communications
with him, asked if they should elect new bishops,
but Augusta refused his consent. After his liberation he
resumed his rule over the community, residing first at
Brandeis-on-the-Adler, afterwards at Jungbunzlau. The
obstinacy and tenacity, not to say narrow-mindedness,
which is ever characteristic of Augusta, involved him in
incessant controversies during the last years of his life.
It is perhaps to his opponents that should be traced the
rather unfavourable account of his last years, according
to which he "found great pleasure in expensive
clothes and furs, as well as in select dishes, handsome
carriages, and generally in an ostentatious manner of
living."</p>

<p>Like so many members of the Unity, Augusta was a
voluminous writer, but some of his works have been
lost, and many of the others have remained in MS. Of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>one of them, the <i>Sumovnik</i> (Summary), Blahoslav, who
had seen the MS., writes: "As that book, the <i>Summary</i>,
has already come into the hands of many pious and
sensible people, it will, if it sees the light, cause the
members of the Unity and others also to jump up from
terror. The book is indeed remarkable, great, and no
doubt for many of great value; and I do not doubt that
this manner of writing Bohemian and the style of writing
will also please many. And some of the young, no
doubt, will be found whom not only these many unheard-of
things, but also the new words and phrases will
please, and they will with pleasure wish to use them.
But as I write my judgment on this book, also <i>non ut</i>
<i>theologus sed ut grammaticus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> that is to say, (I write) not
of the contents of the book, <i>quod non est hujus loci</i>,<a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> but
only of the form of language <i>de genere sermonis de verbis</i>
<i>et phrasibus</i>."<a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The continuation of Blahoslav's commentary
on the "<i>Sumovnik</i>" is rather disappointing. It
consists merely of critical remarks on the diction and
style of Augusta. With the exception of the remark that
heretics who love impious speeches generally also write
in a monstrous style, we are told nothing of the "unheard-of
things" contained in the book. It must, however, be
remembered that Bohemian theologians of the sixteenth
century&mdash;to whom every one who differed from their
opinions was "Antichrist"&mdash;were very much given to
expressions of horror and terror in their writings. Of
Augusta's other works, his <i>Profession of creed sent in the</i>
<i>name of the whole Unity to his Majesty at Augsburg</i>, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span><i>Dispute of Brother Augusta with the Calixtine (Utraquist)</i>
<i>Clergy</i>, and more particularly his collection of hymns,
enjoyed for a time great popularity. The hymns of
Augusta, in particular, were widely used by the brethren
up to the time of the dissolution of the Unity. Blahoslav,
the only literary critic of this period, gives his
opinion of Augusta in these words: "Brother John
Augusta," he writes, "was a remarkable and great man,
who wrote many books as well as hymns. All that he
wrote before he was imprisoned was written in good
Bohemian; phrases <i>excult&aelig;</i>, <i>verba selecta</i>; <i>delectabatur</i>
<i>admodum archaismis</i>, <i>tamen decenter</i>. <i>In summa totum</i>
<i>genus dicendi fuit floridum atque excultum</i>. <i>Valebat ingenio</i>
<i>et memoria</i>, <i>ac diligenter legebat bonos authores</i> in our
Bohemian language. <i>Fluebat igitur sua vis copiosius et</i>
<i>exultans</i>, though he sometimes wished to be too <i>lepidus</i>
<i>et asiaticus</i>.... In his sermons he seemed somewhat
coarse though fervent. <i>Ardebant omnia</i>, words, pronunciation,
and gesticulation. <i>Referrebat zelo illo magna</i>
<i>ex parte Lutherum</i>. When, twenty-six years ago, I heard
Augusta, and shortly afterwards Luther, it appeared
to me that I had never heard two such enthusiastic
preachers, nor two who in every way so greatly resembled
one another."</p>

<p>A somewhat younger contemporary of Augusta was
Brother Blahoslav, whom I have just quoted, and who,
like him, also became one of the bishops of the Unity.
His writings differ somewhat from those of the brethren
I have mentioned above. The influence of humanism,
absent from their works, is distinctly noticeable in
Blahoslav. He also wrote on theology&mdash;what Bohemian
writer of that period did not?&mdash;but it is evident that other
studies were far more to his taste. He tells us, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
in the last chapter of his <i>Grammar</i>, that, in consequence
of the state of his health, "writing on more serious, and
ever on theological matters, was beyond his strength;"
but there is no doubt that this statement should be considered
as apologetic. Many of the brethren probably
thought that their bishops should devote themselves
exclusively to theological studies. From the same reason,
also, Blahoslav mentions, in justification of his
philological studies, that the Unity had intrusted him
with the task of translating the New Testament into
Bohemian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blahoslav</span> was born at P&#345;erov (Prerau) in Moravia,
then one of the centres of the Unity, in 1523. In early
youth he studied at the school which the brethren had
established there. He then travelled to complete his
studies; visited Wittenberg&mdash;where he heard Luther
preach&mdash;K&ouml;nigsberg, and Basel. On his return to his
country, he was first employed as teacher at the school
which the brethren had established at Prost&#283;jov. He
here had as a pupil John of &#381;erotin, member of a family
that always supported the Unity, the father of Charles
of &#381;erotin,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> who was famous during the last years of
Bohemian independence. The authorities of the Unity
afterwards sent Blahoslav to Jung Bunzlau (or Mlad&aacute;
Boleslav) in Bohemia, where he was employed in arranging
the archives of the community. He here began the
composition of the great historical work that was in his
own time his principal claim to literary fame, but which
has perhaps irreparably been lost.</p>

<p>In the year 1557 Blahoslav became an elder or member
of the smaller council of the Unity, and somewhat
later on he was chosen as one of the bishops, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>Eibensch&uuml;tz (Ivan&#269;ice) in Moravia became his habitual
residence. Like all the bishops of the brethren, he, however,
spent much of his time in travel, visiting the scattered
communities. He soon became one of the foremost
members of the Unity, and in consequence of his enlightened
and conciliatory nature was often employed as a
negotiator. In 1555 and on several subsequent occasions
he visited Vienna, where Archduke Maximilian, afterwards
the Emperor Maximilian II., who had by the Estates already
been recognised as heir to the Bohemian throne,
then resided. The mediator between Blahoslav and the
Archduke was the Lutheran preacher Pfauser,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> who for
a time had great influence over Maximilian. The ability
of Blahoslav on several occasions protected the Unity
from the dangers to which, as a community not recognised
by Bohemian law, it always was exposed. When
Augusta returned from prison, differences of opinion
between the two bishops arose, of which we have no
exact account. It is, however, certain that Blahoslav
disapproved of Augusta's sympathy with the German Protestants,
particularly Luther and Melanchthon. Blahoslav's
intense devotion to his own language no doubt
rendered him hostile to everything that tended to increase
German influence in Bohemia. Augusta, to win
over to his side some of the oldest among the brethren,
in whom Chel&#269;icky's hatred for the "band of masters of
colleges" was yet not quite extinct, expressed in his sermons
great contempt for learning and culture. In
answer Blahoslav wrote his <i>Filipika proti Misomus&uuml;m</i>
(the enemies of the Muses), which I shall presently
notice. Blahoslav, whose health had long been failing,
died at Krumau in 1571, a year before Bishop Augusta.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<p>According to Dr. Jire&#269;ek, the total sum of the works
of Blahoslav amounts to twenty-eight; many of them,
however, including his most important work, have been
lost. His controversial writings on theology, as was
then usual, mostly took the form of letters. Such writings
are the letters to Brother Zachary, to Martin of
&#381;&aacute;tec (Saaz), to the Lord Marshal Berthold of L&iacute;pa,
&amp;c. Like Augusta, Blahoslav was a great writer of
hymns, many of which are preserved in the <i>Kancionali</i>
or hymn-books of the Unity. The composition of these
hymns no doubt induced Blahoslav to write the curious
treatise entitled <i>Music</i>, or, to give the full name as prefixed
to the second edition of Blahoslav's book, "Music,
that is, a small book containing the information necessary
for singers. Written in the Bohemian language on
the wish of several good friends, and first printed in the
year of the Lord 1558 at Olm&uuml;tz; now carefully corrected
and reprinted; rules and instructions necessary
to chanters and composers of hymns are added." In
the preface to this quaint work Blahoslav writes: "A
branch of pride, and not the least one, consists in the
desire to be known to many, to be considered witty and
sensible, and to be esteemed in consequence. The
desire to obtain distinction by one's virtues and other
similar things is indeed praiseworthy. Yet it is senseless
to undertake too difficult a work and strive with much
effort for an object as vain as the steam of smoke.
There are many, too, who might be compared to that
Herostratus, who, wishing to obtain great fame, burnt
down the great Temple of Diana at the risk of his life....
Those only will I mention who, in our days, publish
books in the Bohemian language, wishing thus to
obtain great fame for themselves; some who wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
help their neighbours as much as they can, from sincere
love and in a beseeming manner, I do not allude to; on
the contrary, I praise their pious undertakings and holy
labour; but many are guided and incited by that branch
of pride which I have mentioned above, which drives
them to attempt that also which is beyond their power.
Thus they do what they are unfit to do, thinking it
sufficient that they have done it. But how? that they
don't think of or care. Many out of good Latin or
German books make bad Bohemian ones, serving no
other purpose than that the noble Bohemian language,
already somewhat spoilt, should become yet more
corrupted. This will perhaps bring matters to that
point that the Bohemians will become unable to speak
Bohemian correctly and rightly to understand their
language and its peculiarities. Thus did it happen to
the Italians, who had so amended their language that
when the old Italians&mdash;that is, the Latinists, Cicero and
the others&mdash;came to them, they could not understand
them. And what happens with regard to translations
from other languages, that happens also with regard to
the composition and publication of various little songs,
particularly when those who undertake this task do so
not for the purpose of stirring up others to piety and
godliness; often indeed they (the writers of verses), on
the contrary, seek and desire by means of their useless,
mischievous, and even obscene verses, which pre-occupy
men's minds, either to obtain the praise of men and
worldly advantage, or even to insult and injure their
guiltless fellow-creatures. Who can doubt that such
men should be classed with the senseless Herostratus,
and that they deserve derision and contempt rather than
flattering praise?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"For such godless people I should not wish to work;
nor do they require it. Nature itself entices a man to
frivolities, the world gives sufficient evil example, and
Satan himself drills them and whispers in their ears
what they are to do and when. Thus that Naso, an
excellent master of the devil's works, wrote well when
he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Est deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Impetus hic sacrce semina mentis habet.</i>'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Satan excited him (Ovid), and sharpened his wits to
enable him to write those insidious and penetrating
<i>carmina</i> on matters of love, by means of which he then
caught young men, just as a bird-catcher catches titmice
on a sticky lime-twig. Why, even among those of our
own language (<i>i.e.</i> nation) there were similar verses,
before the devil induced the people of our corner of
the world to give way entirely to gluttony and drunkenness.
Such worldly songs, written down in musical
notes or in words in a masterly manner, we remember
to have heard in our childhood, and we wondered at
them. Such people (the writers of worldly songs) then
I do not endeavour to instruct. They have their own
good teacher who incites them."</p>

<p>Blahoslav's views expressed in his preface are infinitely
more interesting than the contents of the little book
itself. Blahoslav deals in separate chapters with the
subjects of songs, the words, the rhythm, the "clauses,"
and the syllables.</p>

<p>The <i>Replika proti Misomus&#363;m</i>&mdash;written, like all the
existent works of Blahoslav, with the exception of a
small Latin historical treatise, in the national language&mdash;has
already been mentioned. Bishop Augusta had, in
his sermons and elsewhere, spoken contemptuously of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
learning, and it was believed among the brethren that
he had Blahoslav particularly in view. The latter repelled
these attacks in the treatise which I have just
named. "It is, and has been for years," he writes, "the
custom of some somewhat prominent men to quote, for
the purpose of disparaging the ancient teachers (<i>i.e.</i> the
fathers of the Church), a saying of Brother Lucas, according
to which he had written nothing which he had
not found within the Unity. And they explained it thus:
that Brother Lucas had taken nothing from the ancient
teachers, but that he had learnt what the Unity possessed
when he joined it, and then wrote, &amp;c. I also
a year ago heard Brother Augusta state this. Most
certainly those who thus expound Brother Lucas did not
understand, and do not understand his words. Could
but Brother Lucas hear them, what evil thanks would
he render them! Where is that saintly man, Brother
Lawrence Krasonick&yacute;, that he could by word of mouth
vividly explain this to them. What he has written in
his books they will not read, because of the weakness
of their intellects, and because their minds are full of
vanity.</p>

<p>"But as those men who could have treated this subject
usefully are no longer with us, I will write down
briefly what is now on my mind.</p>

<p>"In the days of Brother Lucas the Unity had many
enemies against whom he had to write by order of the
elders. He had to write in a fashion that did not stir
up enemies nor open the gates of the Unity to the foe,
but rather reduced to silence, and even to assent, one
opponent by this, another by that argument. That he
continued obnoxious to some in spite of his labours is
known. There were also some who feared that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
lead them back to Rome, the doctors (<i>i.e.</i> the ecclesiastics
of the Church of Rome), &amp;c. And because of
these foolish and false ideas about him he had to make
such speeches as should close the mouths of some.
Real truth did Brother Lucas speak when he said that
he wrote nothing that he did not find in the Unity. He
found in it truth as the essence (of doctrine) as to service
(ritual), &amp;c. This truth he wrote, he adorned, he spread,
explaining its various branches wisely and to many....
Some one will perhaps say that I praise learning and
the learned. Yes, it is true that I praise both learning
or knowledge and cultivated people. But I do not praise
those who use their learning or knowledge for evil purposes.
I will say, as an example, 'We praise wine, and
we praise also drinking or the use of wine, but drunkenness
and drunken people we do not praise.' Generally
we do not praise the evil use of God's good gifts.
'Abusus non tollit rem.' The sword is good, but it can
serve one to good, another to evil purposes.</p>

<p>"Others again may say: 'You attach too much importance
to learning and the learned.' Indeed some
good men say that through learning discord has entered
into Churches, and that this might happen to the Unity
also. He would indeed attribute too much importance
to learning and knowledge who should fancy that without
the 'seven arts' God's truth, that is, the Gospel,
cannot be preached, or that our salvation is founded on
this learning or knowledge. But he who would say this
must indeed be very silly."</p>

<p>"I, on my part, hold that those who work for the
word of God require for that purpose a special gift of
God which is called eloquence, which enables them to
declaim, to teach, to admonish, to warn. The Lord at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
first gave eloquence to His servants as a gift in so miraculous
a manner, that it was not necessary that they should
learn. But then wonders and miracles ceased. Henceforth,
as the Spirit of God recognised that eloquence is
necessary to the Church, it is not harmful to teach
eloquence whenever and to whatever person it is possible
(to do so). Surely a man cannot wait till God miraculously
throws down eloquence to him from heaven!
That would indeed be as if a peasant neither sowed nor
ploughed, but waited till manna rained down on him
from heaven."</p>

<p>"Do not our young men, I say, when they are taught
to preach, learn besides piety and knowledge of God's
word, eloquence as well? It is obvious to all that many
of these young men, though they do not know Latin,
are more learned in their speech, and more eloquent
than some fairly learned Latinists. Still it is certain that
if, besides their other studies, they also learnt Latin and
were acquainted with dialectics and rhetoric, they would
be much more intelligent, more capable, readier for all
work, and more useful."</p>

<p>Blahoslav here expresses the views of the more cultivated
members of the Unity, men to whom to so great
an extent the literary development of Bohemia is due.
That it was necessary that Blahoslav should write such
a treatise proves, on the other hand, that the ideas of
Chel&#269;icky and the "small party" still found adherents
among the brethren.</p>

<p>Another work of Blahoslav that has been fortunately
preserved is his <i>Grammatika &#268;esk&aacute;</i>. Only one MS. of
this work is known, and that was only discovered by
Mr. Hradil in 1857 in the library of the Theresian College
in Vienna. This book is indeed an example of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
obscurity which still covers ancient Bohemian literature,
and of the possibility that, of the many other ancient
books that are known to have existed but have been
lost, some may be yet recovered. The condition of
Bohemian literature in this respect recalls rather that of
ancient literatures than that of other modern European
countries. Blahoslav's <i>Grammar</i> has great interest in
spite of its rather unattractive name, which is not indeed
quite correct. Besides a full account of the construction
of the Bohemian language based on Latin grammar,
with which Blahoslav was thoroughly acquainted, the
book contains a series of short but very pertinent critical
notes on some earlier Bohemian writers, beginning with
Hus. I have already quoted Blahoslav's criticisms on
Lucas, Krasonick&yacute;, and Augusta. It may be interesting
here to quote his self-criticism also. Under the heading
of "The Works of Blahoslav" he writes: "It seems to
me, if some think that my opinion on this subject is
just, that no good Bohemian can blame my manner of
writing Bohemian, as shown in my version of the New
Testament, which has been twice published and printed
at Ivan&#269;ice. Also of the little book called <i>Additions to</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> notes on) <i>Music</i>, or simply <i>Music</i>. I think that,
particularly in its last edition, it contains good and also
graceful Bohemian writing. Of other similar works of
mine I am silent; let the result show the truth. 'Decere
nam mihi videtur ut de metipso quam modestissime
loquor, cum mihi sim bene conscius, quam et mihi sit
curta suppellex.' We know that we are all imperfect,
but yet to a different degree, some more and some
less."</p>

<p>Posterity has on the whole confirmed Blahoslav's
judgment. His works, particularly his translation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
the New Testament, are still considered models of
Bohemian writing. One cannot, however, help regretting
that he, who was so severe on "Latinisms", should
have interspersed his writings with Latin words, and
sometimes with Latin sentences, that are most disturbing
and irritating to the reader. Blahoslav seems to
have inserted these patches of Latin as evidence of his
learning, in the same manner as English novelists some
time ago were given to introducing into their writings
fragments of French as evidence of their knowledge of
the ways of society.</p>

<p>Of later writers of the Unity I may mention Brother
Jaffet. He entered the ecclesiastical service of the Unity
in 1576, and afterwards became a member of the "small
council". He also was a voluminous author, but many
of his works have been lost and the others remain in
MS. His most important works were the <i>Voice of the</i>
<i>Watchman</i>, which appeared about the year 1600, and
a work which he published in the year 1607 under the
somewhat long-winded title of <i>The Sword of Goliath for</i>
<i>the defence of God's people against their enemies, that is,</i>
<i>the Description of the ... constant succession ... of true</i>
<i>and genuine bishops and priests within the Unity of the</i>
<i>Brethren</i>. In the preface to this work Jaffet declares
that his purpose is to prove that the brethren have
always preserved the apostolic succession which they
received from the Waldenses. As a proof of this assertion,
Jaffet published a list of the ordinations which took
place within the Unity from its beginning. This list
Dr. Gindely, who had thoroughly studied the history of
the Unity, declared to be spurious. Brother Jaffet died
at Hora&#382;dovic in 1614. He was one of those enemies
of Rome on whom vengeance was wrought after their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
death. When his burial-place, the former Minorite
monastery of Hora&#382;dovic, was in 1621 returned to the
monks of that order, the remains of Brother Jaffet and
of three other Bohemian brethren were disinterred and
burnt in the churchyard.</p>

<p>It would be very easy to continue this account of
the theologians of the Unity. All their writings still
have an intense interest for Bohemians. Writing for
other readers, I shall limit myself to the authors already
mentioned, who are indeed the most prominent and
representative members of the Unity.</p>

<p>It would, however, be impossible to pass in silence
the name of <span class="smcap">Wenceslas Budovec of Budova</span>. He
was a prominent leader of the Brethren, a very striking
figure in Bohemian political life, and belongs to literature
also, as the author of several Bohemian works,
mostly of a theological character. He was born in
1547 as a member of a noble but not opulent family,
and was educated in accordance with the doctrine of the
Unity. When eighteen years of age, Budova, as was
then customary for young Bohemian nobles, undertook
extensive travels, visiting Germany, the Netherlands,
England, France, and Italy; that he visited Rome also
is specially recorded by his biographers. Shortly after
his return to Bohemia in 1577, he was attached to
the embassy which Rudolph II., German emperor and
King of Bohemia, despatched to Constantinople. A
man of studious nature, and, like most Bohemians of
his time, intensely interested in theological research,
Budova employed his spare time&mdash;always granted amply
to an able man who is member of an embassy but not
the ambassador&mdash;in endeavouring to obtain information
on the Mohammedan religion. The result of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
studies was his celebrated <i>Anti-Alkoran</i>, which I shall
again refer to. It may here be mentioned incidentally,
as a proof of the bitterness of religious animosity in
Bohemia at the beginning of the seventeenth century,
that Budova was afterwards accused by the Romanists
of having written a book in praise of Mohammedanism;
whereas the mere name of the book should have
been sufficient to disprove so absurd an assertion. After
spending about seven years in Turkey, Budova returned
to Bohemia, and took an important part in the political
events that led to the granting of the "Letter of Majesty"
to the Bohemian Protestants<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> by Rudolph II. in 1609.
He acted, indeed, not only as leader of the brethren, but
of all those who were opposed to the increasing pretensions
of the Church of Rome. The Bohemian national
movement, as Dr. Gindely has remarked, acquired
through him a somewhat Puritan character. When
Budova presided over the Protestant meetings, he always
called on all present to pray before he opened the proceedings.
All then fell on their knees and sang a hymn.
The signing of the "Letter of Majesty", and of the agreement
that was drawn up simultaneously,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> is principally
due to Budova. Though the force of circumstances prevented
these enactments from entering fully into practice,
and the events of 1618 and 1620 swept away all
religious liberty in Bohemia, they might, had time permitted,
have established in Bohemia a just and fair
system of religious toleration.</p>

<p>In the events which followed the memorable Defenestration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>of Prague in 1618, Budova played a less prominent
part, He was, however, chosen as one of the "directors", \<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
and was also a member of the deputation that welcomed
King Frederick at the Bohemian frontier. The new
king appointed Budova president of the Court of Appeal,
and in consequence of his former relations with Turkey
he was attached as special commissioner to the Turkish
ambassador who appeared at the court of Prague. He
was present at the banquet given to the Turkish embassy
by Count Thurn, of which Slavata has left us so
insidious, and probably mendacious, an account.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> After
the battle of the White Mountain, Budova accompanied
his wife and other members of his family to the frontier,
where they were in safety. He then returned to Prague,
stating that he could not abandon the Bohemian crown
that had been intrusted to his custody. When asked
why he had not fled, he spoke the often-quoted words:
"I am weary of my days. May God deign to receive
my soul, so that I may not behold the disaster which,
as I know, has overcome my country." Budova was
one of the Bohemian leaders who were decapitated on
June 21, 1621, and is mentioned in Sk&aacute;la's account of
that tragic event.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> He refused the assistance of both
Capuchins and Jesuits, and as no member of the Unity
was allowed to assist the dying brethren, he walked
resolutely and alone to the scaffold.</p>

<p>Of several religious works of Budova that have been
preserved, the already-mentioned <i>Anti-Alkoran</i> is most
worthy of notice. In the preface Budova explains how
the book came to be written. The firm and intense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>religious feeling of the man is noticeable in every word.
"From my earliest youth," he says, "God influenced my
parents to that purpose that they sent me out of Bohemia
to distant countries that I might acquire learning, and
this happened in 1565. After having viewed the most
prominent Christian countries, and having spent some
time studying at academies, and seen the courts and
governments of the foremost potentates, kings, and princes,
and also the Italian land and Rome, I by God's grace
returned to Bohemia and to my dear family in 1577.
Then, however, I became very desirous of visiting the
Eastern countries&mdash;those that the Turk, that Gog and
Magog, who is the chief enemy of Christendom, has
taken from the Christians, and now rules&mdash;and of seeing
what the manner of the infamous Turkish religion is,
and how the work of God continues among those
Christians who live under the Turkish yoke, as it were
in a Babylonian captivity."</p>

<p>Budova then tells us how he became a member of
the numerous embassy that accompanied the ambassador
John of Zinzendorf to Constantinople. While
most of his companions, after a short stay at Constantinople,
continued their travels to "Jerusalem, Damascus,
Babylon, Arabia, and Persia," Budova was detained
there, for he had accepted the position of <i>hofmistr</i> (master
of the ceremonies) to the ambassador. "I then,"
Budova writes, "decided to make inquiries as to what
the religion, or rather irreligion, of the Turks really was,
and, as it were, to outline and depict for others that
Turkish Antichrist with his fables and other frauds. It
was of great assistance to me that I had with me a copy
of the <i>Alkoran</i> (Koran), which in Spain had been translated
from the ancient Arabic, such as it was at the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
of Mahomet, into the Latin speech. This book was
then, at the time of Luther, about the year 1550, printed
with a preface by Philip Melanchthon. I, possessing
this work, often entered into discussions, not only with
the Turks, but also with the renegades&mdash;that means
those who have fallen from the Christian faith, and of
such there are here not hundreds but thousands. The
result was that they themselves were surprised, and had
to laugh at those most foolish fables (of the Koran),
which are sillier than anything that has been taught
by any heathens since the beginning of the world.
Then, overcome by their consciences, they arrived at
this conclusion&mdash;that they did not believe in God and
in eternal life, but that, in accordance with Epicurus
and the Sadduceans, they considered every religion as
a political institution, and favoured such religious doctrines
as were convenient to their bodily welfare, and
contributed to their glory and advantage in the world.
And as at Constantinople I saw all this with my eyes,
that 'Gog and Magog', which in Bohemian can be described
as the secret building, the extraordinary edifice
composed of parts of the New and Old Testament,
in which that Satan (<i>i.e.</i> the Sultan) endeavours to hide
himself with his <i>Alkoran</i>&mdash;as I talked much on these
subjects with Turks and renegades, that is, men who
have abandoned the Christian faith, therefore am I
better able to write on these subjects than those who
only write what they have heard at second-hand." The
<i>Anti-Alkoran</i> is divided into three parts. The first consists
of copious extracts from the edition of the Koran
mentioned in the preface; the second contains a refutation
of the Mohammedan creed. The third part,
scarcely connected with the others, consists of nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
small treatises, which prove that the inclination to
mysticism, that proved so harmful to Komensk&yacute; and
many brethren, existed in Budova's mind also, and that,
like so many of his contemporaries, he was given to
the study of astrology.</p>

<p>Budova's letters, some of which, addressed to Peter
of Rosenberg and preserved in the archives of Wittingau
(T&#345;ebon), have recently been published, bear witness
to the fervent piety so characteristic of Budova.
In a letter addressed to Lord Peter in 1611, Budova
informs his correspondent of the state of public affairs
in Bohemia; he adds: "The Poles have obtained a
victory over the Muscovites, and the German Electors
will meet shortly at N&uuml;remberg. May God deign to
grant that all these matters may, to His honour and
glory, be settled in a manner conducive to the general
welfare, and above all, to concord, love, and enduring
peace; then may we in Bohemia also be able, after all
these incessant tempests, whirlwinds, and storms of the
last three years, to obtain rest, and, as it were, to recover
a little. But God threatens us with the plague, perhaps
wishing to rescue us from the evil things that are preparing
and to render us more obedient to His will and
counsel. I constantly commend your Grace to God's
mercy. May God's love render your Grace and all those
who through God's favour believe in the Lord Christ
day by day more able to find and expect those eternal
heavenly blessings to which with certain faith we look
forward."</p>

<p>This short notice of Budova's literary work would be
incomplete if I omitted to mention that many of the
state papers published by the Provisional Government
of 1618, and by the Government of King Frederick&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>which
both displayed a feverish but futile diplomatic
activity&mdash;are the work of Wenceslas of Budova.</p>

<p>Before referring to Komensk&yacute;, the last great Bohemian
writer of the Unity, mention should be made of some
fruits of the literary activity of the brethren which were
the joint works of several members of the community.
Of these, the most important is the translation of the
Holy Scriptures known as the "Bible of Kralice."
From the time of Hus, when the Bohemian people
obtained free access to the Bible, parts of the Scriptures
had been frequently translated into Bohemian, and
Brother Blahoslav, as already mentioned, published the
whole New Testament in the national language. Towards
the end of the sixteenth century the authorities
of the Unity decided on publishing a complete Bohemian
version of the Bible. Several clergymen of the Unity
took part in the labours necessary for this purpose,
which began in 1577 and ended in 1593, when the complete
version was printed and published at Kralice in
Moravia. Other editions followed in 1596 and 1613.
The New Testament was printed in these editions
exactly according to Blahoslav's already existent translation.
The translation of the Old Testament was the
joint work of several divines. The Bible of Kralice
endeared itself to the Bohemian Protestants in the
course of a very few years. With Komensk&yacute;'s <i>Labyrinth</i>
<i>of the World</i>, that will be mentioned presently,
it was the only book that many Protestants whom the
Austrian Government expelled from Bohemia after the
battle of the White Mountain took into exile with
them. This is referred to in the well-known song of
the Bohemian exiles, in which they are made to say&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Nothing have we taken with us,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Everything is lost;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>We have but our Bible of Kralice,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Our 'Labyrinth of the World.'</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After the forcible re-establishment of the doctrine of
Rome, it became a grave offence to be found in possession
of a copy of the "Bible of Kralice". The Jesuits
in particular were indefatigable in their endeavours to
discover and destroy all copies of the book. The "Bible
of Kralice" has recently been reprinted by the British
Bible Society exactly from the edition of 1613.</p>

<p>Another interesting record of the Unity is the collection
of reports of the proceedings at the general meetings
of the community. It has already been mentioned that
these meetings were very frequent. The numerous
hymn-books ("Kancionaly", as they were called) of the
brethren also deserve notice. They contained hymns
by Brothers Lucas, Augusta, Blahoslav, and many others.
The last Bohemian Kancional was published by Komensk&yacute;
in 1659, when the brethren had already long been
expelled from their native land.</p>

<p>I have now to deal with <span class="smcap">Komensk&yacute;</span>, who, under the
Latinised name of Comenius, is widely known beyond
the limits of Bohemia. The value of Komensk&yacute;'s writings
has been judged very differently at different periods.
His mystic, not to say superstitious and credulous,
nature was particularly antipathetic to a French writer
such as Bayle. The latter has, therefore, in his <i>Dictionnaire</i>
<i>Historique et Critique</i> judged the whole work
of Komensk&yacute; very unfavourably, and this judgment has
often been repeated. With time opinion changed. His
educational works, though for a long time only those
that are little more than school-books were well known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
began again to attract attention. In the present century
the first Bohemian edition of the <i>Didactica Magna</i>
was rediscovered, and extracts were made from the
almost inaccessible Amsterdam folio of 1657, in which
alone some of his educational works are contained. The
very great merits of Komensk&yacute; as an instructor of the
young are now recognised by most prominent teachers,
who alone are competent to give an opinion on this
point.</p>

<p>Recently public opinion has perhaps veered too much
in the contrary direction. Not content with declaring,
what is undeniable, that Komensk&yacute; was a learned and
original writer on educational matters, and the author
of one of the most fascinating allegorical tales that have
ever been written, great importance has been attributed
to his writings on philosophy, or, as he would have
called it, "Pansophy." No one can impartially claim
for Komensk&yacute; high rank as a philosopher, and it is certainly
a mistake to speak of Komensk&yacute;'s system of philosophy.
There is no philosophical system of Komensk&yacute;
in the sense that there exists a philosophical system of
Spinoza. Komensk&yacute; is not only, when writing on "pansophy,"
constantly carried away by mystic ideas&mdash;the
idea of "light," which he interpreted in a mystic manner,
seems ever to have pursued him&mdash;but his "pansophic"
works constantly encroach on the domain of natural
history. This is the more to be regretted, as Komensk&yacute;'s
views on natural history were very often incorrect, and
the fatal credulity which induced him to study the
"prophecies" of Kotter, Ponatovsk&aacute;, and Drabik here
also led him to accept as true the most absurd statements.</p>

<p>The life of Komensk&yacute; is a very sad one, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
patience, resignation, and unlimited trust in God must
win for him the esteem of all sympathetic readers of his
many works. An exile from his country early in life,
only once the hope of a return to Bohemia appeared to
him. It was when, after the victories of Gustavus Adolphus,
his Saxon allies for a time expelled the Catholics
from Bohemia. Komensk&yacute; was then already celebrated
as a writer on educational topics, and he would probably,
had the task of reorganising the schools of
Bohemia been confided to him, have rendered these
schools models for all Europe. He indeed confidently
expresses this idea in his writings. But Wallenstein
soon drove the Saxons out of Bohemia, and it is in any
case doubtful whether the Lutheran Saxons would have
intrusted Komensk&yacute; with the mission which he so
ardently desired. Fate willed it that he was only able
to make isolated attempts at establishing his new system
of education in various countries and without continuity.
The circumstances of his life were also as unfavourable
as possible to his career as a writer. Travelling
from Moravia to Bohemia, thence to Poland, Germany,
England, Sweden, Hungary, Holland, ever unable to
obtain tranquillity, often in financial difficulties, twice
deprived of his library by fire, forced to write school-books
when he was planning metaphysical works that he
believed to be of the greatest value, he always undauntedly
continued his vast literary undertakings. The critic
who judges Komensk&yacute; from a purely literary standpoint
will probably give preference over all his other works to
the thoughtful, pessimistic, yet sometimes playful, allegorical
narrative which he has called the <i>Labyrinth of the</i>
<i>World</i>. This opinion coincides with that of the people
of Bohemia. Since they have been free to read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
works of their ancient writers, no book is more constantly
in their hands than the <i>Labyrinth</i>.</p>

<p>Before noticing a few of the many works of Komensk&yacute;,
I shall give a brief account of his adventurous life.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
John Amos Komensk&yacute; was born at Ungarisch Brod in
Moravia, or, according to some authorities, in the small
neighbouring town of Nivnice, in 1592. He received his
first education at Ungarisch Brod, and after the early
death of his parents visited the school of Stra&#382;&#382;nic,
where Drabik&mdash;destined to have so fatal an influence on
Komensk&yacute;&mdash;was also then studying. Komensk&yacute;'s early
impressions of the schools of the Unity were decidedly
unfavourable. He complained that the masters made no
attempt to attract the interest and attention of their pupils,
overburdened their memories by insisting on unnecessary
mechanical enumerations of words and facts, and
stimulated the failing memory by the incessant and
exaggerated application of corporal punishment. In the
<i>Labyrinth</i>, written in Komensk&yacute;'s youth, he graphically
describes his school experiences. It is probable that
these experiences first suggested to him his vast plan
of remodelling the then accepted system of education.
From Stra&#382;nic Komensk&yacute; proceeded to Prerau (P&#345;erov),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>then one of the centres of the Unity. He here continued
his studies in view of becoming a member of the clergy
of the community. He seems when very young already
to have resolved to adopt this career.</p>

<p>For the purpose of completing his studies Komensk&yacute;
was by the chiefs of the Unity sent to the University of
Herborn in Nassau. That university, founded at the
end of the sixteenth century by John the Elder, Count of
Nassau, was then at the height of its fame. The religious
teaching there was in accordance with the "Catechism of
Heidelberg", that is to say, mainly founded on Calvin's
views. The Unity was more in sympathy with these
views than with the teaching of the Utraquist University
of Prague. The brethren, therefore, often sent their
promising youths to Herborn, though the regulation
that the students dined at three different tables, where
different meals were served according to the payment
made by each student, offended their democratic views.
At Herborn Komensk&yacute; became acquainted with Altsted
(or Altstedius), who, though still a young man, was
already celebrated as a writer on educational subjects.
His theories had a considerable influence on Komensk&yacute;.
From Herborn Komensk&yacute; proceeded to Heidelberg,
where he also pursued his studies for some time.
Before returning to his country he made a somewhat
extensive journey through Germany and the Netherlands.
Writing forty years later, he tells us that at this
time (in 1613) he first visited Amsterdam, "the pearl of
towns, the ornament of the Netherlands, the delight of
Europe."</p>

<p>In 1614 Komensk&yacute; returned to Moravia, and was
ordained a minister of the Unity in 1616, as soon as he
had attained the necessary age. He was first sent to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
small town of Fulneck in Moravia, where he married
and spent the happiest and almost the only tranquil
years of his life. It was not his destiny to continue long
undisturbed in the pursuit of his religious duties, and
of the studies to which he was already devoted. The
events of the Bohemian war cast their shadow even over
the peaceful community of Fulneck. Rumours of the
events of the war between Bohemia and Austria occasionally
reached the brethren. As Komensk&yacute; wrote:
"Lightning shines before it strikes, and by its light we
could see the glooming, gathering clouds of persecution,"
After the battle of the White Mountain the brethren, as
the most decided opponents of Rome, were naturally
the first to suffer. Detachments of troops, generally
Spaniards, who were chosen for this purpose because
of their greater bigotry and ferocity, scoured Bohemia
and Moravia in every direction, burning down the settlements
of the brethren, and killing or driving from the
country the members of the communities. In 1621 a
Spanish detachment attacked Fulneck and burnt down
the town, forcing the brethren to fly for their lives. The
MSS. and library of Komensk&yacute; were here for the first,
but unhappily not for the last time burnt and destroyed.
Komensk&yacute; himself managed to escape and sought refuge
in Bohemia at Brandeis-on-the-Adler, which has already
been mentioned as one of the centres of the Unity. The
little town then belonged to Charles, Lord of &#381;erotin.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Though during his whole life a devoted member of the
Unity, &#381;erotin had remained faithful to the House of
Austria during the war that had just ended, and had
even been menaced by the Moravian nobles, who had
adopted the cause of Frederick of the Palatinate. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>acknowledgment of his services, he was not by the
Catholics included in the general decree of exile, and the
Austrian authorities at first even overlooked the fact that
many members of &#381;erotin's Church, among whom was
Komensk&yacute;, sought refuge at Brandeis. Komensk&yacute;'s
intense literary activity, that had already begun at Fulneck,
continued at Brandeis. There, besides minor
works, the <i>Labyrinth of the World</i> was written, though
the book was afterwards enlarged.</p>

<p>All Komensk&yacute;'s writings while at Brandeis bear witness
of an intense mental depression. Not only did he feel
deeply the ruin and dispersion of the religious community
which he had just begun to serve, but he also
about this time lost his young wife, probably during the
flight from Fulneck to Brandeis. Writing of this period
about ten years later Komensk&yacute; says: "God willed it
that, not only through the lamentable war, but also
through the plague that spread throughout the country,
great slaughter took place. I thus lost miserably my wife
and my children, relations, connections, and kind benefactors.
I suffered anxiety on anxiety that filled my heart.
But what was harder to bear than all else was that God
appeared to have abandoned our country and Church
and left us orphans, for all the churches of Bohemia
and Moravia were deprived of their faithful spiritual
guides, many subjects lost their evangelic lords, these
again lost their beloved subjects,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and the servants of
God lost their churches."</p>

<p>The respite granted the brethren through the intercession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>of &#381;erotin did not last long. Every year the
persecution of all in Bohemia who were outside the pale
of the Church of Rome became severer and their position
more precarious. At a secret meeting of the brethren
in 1625, at which Komensk&yacute; was present, it was decided
altogether to abandon Bohemia, and a discussion arose
as to the country where the members of the Unity should
seek refuge. It was finally decided that the brethren
should separate, some proceeding to Poland, others to
Hungary and Transylvania. Poland then had a large
Protestant population, and this is still the case as regards
the two other countries mentioned. Before finally
leaving Bohemia, it was decided that messengers should
be sent out in different directions to obtain information
as to where the brethren could find quarters.
Komensk&yacute;, with two companions, started for Poland.
In that country Count Raphael Lescynski, himself a
member of the Unity, was known as a warm friend of
the brethren.</p>

<p>During his journey Komensk&yacute; first heard of the so called
prophecies of one Christopher Kotter. Characteristically
enough Komensk&yacute; immediately forgot all
other preoccupations and obtained an interview with the
"prophet." Henceforth his belief in Kotter was implicit,
and he immediately decided on translating into Latin
and into Bohemian the German prophecies, which are a
tissue of absurdities.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The fact that a generally respected
Protestant divine as Komensk&yacute; had desired an interview
with Kotter of course greatly increased the man's celebrity.
Even the Elector of Brandenburg, and Frederick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>ex-king of Bohemia, requested that he should be presented
to them. From Germany Komensk&yacute; continued his journey
to Poland, and having, as he tells us, received satisfactory
assurances from Count Lescynski, he returned
for the last time to Bohemia towards the end of the year
1626.</p>

<p>He here again fell under the influence of a visionist, in
whom he thoroughly believed, and whose hallucinations
he even many years afterwards considered worthy of
being recorded in print. Julian Ponatovsk&aacute;, an impecunious
Polish nobleman, had been received as a member
of the Unity and appointed preacher at Mlad&aacute; Boleslav.
When the communities of the brethren were dispersed,
Charles of &#381;erotin secured Ponatovsk&aacute;'s safety by appointing
him to the office of librarian at his castle at Nam&#283;st
in Moravia. Christina, Ponatovsk&aacute;'s daughter, appears to
have been of a highly hysterical nature, which, added to
the intense religious excitement of the times, induced her
to deliver "prophecies," which were generally received
with the greatest interest. The pathological side of the
question need not be dealt with here. It is sufficient to
state that Christina, who had recently been reading the
Revelation of St. John, declared that she had heard the
voice of the Lord, who had chosen her as intermediary
for the purpose of informing the faithful of the approaching
defeat of Rome.</p>

<p>It was the misfortune of Komensk&yacute; to be brought
accidentally into contact with the "prophetess." Christina
had not joined her father in Moravia, but remained
at Branna in Bohemia, not far from T&#345;eme&#353;na, where
Komensk&yacute; was then staying. Christina suddenly became
dangerously ill at Branna, and as the minister of the
Unity who resided at T&#345;eme&#353;na happened to be absent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Komensk&yacute; was sent to Branna in his stead. He has
given a rather curious account of his visit to the prophetess.
She appeared to be in a state of ecstasy, and
constantly repeated the words "Bridegroom, bridegroom!"
Somewhat later she began to communicate
her prophecies to Komensk&yacute; and the other persons
present. She again prophesied that the Protestants
would shortly obtain a complete victory over Austria
and the Pope. To these prophecies also Komensk&yacute;
gave immediate implicit faith. Though he soon left
Branna, he remained in communication with Christina.
The latter soon recovered from her illness, but continued
to prophesy; her prophecies, indeed, became even more
definite. She now announced that, through the will of
her heavenly bridegroom, Jesus, Papacy would be abolished;
that the Turks would be converted to Christianity,
and that Ferdinand II. and Wallenstein would
perish by violent deaths. Wallenstein was then residing
at Ji&#269;in in Bohemia, and Christina, accompanied by a
female friend, proceeded there to acquaint him with her
prophecies. The great general was not at home, but
Countess Wallenstein, who saw Christina, was greatly
embarrassed, and consulted some Jesuits on the subject
of her visionary visitor. The Jesuits advised that Christina
should immediately be sent to jail; but it was finally
agreed merely to remind her of the decree that had
already banished from Bohemia all members of the
Unity. Wallenstein was, on his return home, informed of
the visit of the prophetess. He smiled, and remarked
that the Emperor indeed received messages from Rome,
Constantinople, and Madrid, but that he had received
one from heaven.</p>

<p>Christina returned to Branna, and as her father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
had died meanwhile, she decided to join Komensk&yacute;
and his wife&mdash;he had remarried very shortly after the
death of his first wife&mdash;and a party of other exiles, who
were on the point of leaving Bohemia. They set out
in January 1628; and on crossing the frontier of their
country in the direction of Silesia, "they all knelt down
and prayed to God with cries and many tears, entreating
Him that He would not finally avert His mercy from
their beloved country nor allow the seed of His word to
perish within it." In February Komensk&yacute; arrived at Lissa,
a small town in that part of Poland that is now known
as the Prussian province of Posen. Ponatovsk&aacute; for
some time continued a member of Komensk&yacute;'s household,
and the controversy concerning the true inspiration
of her prophecies raged for a considerable time. A joint
meeting of doctors and ministers of the Unity did not
settle the question, as the opinion of the doctors was in
direct opposition to that of the ecclesiastics, of whom
Komensk&yacute; was one. The latter never wavered in his
belief in Christina's prophecies.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> He maintained that
it could nowhere be proved that the Church had been
deprived of the gift of prophecy. Before dismissing
Christina Ponatovsk&aacute; it should be stated that some time
after these events she married a young man employed at
the printing-work of the Unity at Lissa, had two sons and
three daughters, and in later years "disliked all reference
to her prophecies."</p>

<p>It would, however, be doing Komensk&yacute; bitter wrong
if we supposed that he was, while at Lissa, exclusively
occupied with the prophecies of Kotter and Ponatovsk&aacute;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<p>The period of his first residence at Lissa was, on the
contrary, one of incessant and fruitful hard work. His
duties as a preacher and schoolmaster were fulfilled
with equally great conscientiousness, and, from the few
sermons that have been preserved, it appears that in this
respect also his ability was exceptional. It was also at
this time that most of Komensk&yacute;'s educational works
were written, though many were re-modelled later. It
is therefore very difficult to fix the chronological order
of Komensk&yacute;'s works, and even to decide whether the
Bohemian or the Latin version of some of them is the
original one. The beginning of the "pansophic" studies
also dates from this time, and the <i>Physica</i>, Komensk&yacute;'s
first philosophical work, was completed as early as in
1632.</p>

<p>Of external events there is at this period of Komensk&yacute;'s
life little that requires mention. The monotonous life
of the brethren was only occasionally interrupted by the
echoes of the events of the Thirty Years' War. In 1631
the news of Gustavus Adolphus's great victory at Breitenfeld,
and in the following year that of the occupation of
Bohemia by the Saxons, reached Lissa. I have already
noticed the brief and vain hopes that Komensk&yacute; founded
on these events.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice that even in those troublous
times Komensk&yacute;'s literary work soon became known.
His "pansophic" studies, that appeal so little to modern
readers, then attracted almost more attention than his
really valuable educational works. Among those who
appear to have taken an early interest in Komensk&yacute;'s
"pansophy" was Samuel Hartlib, a learned Englishman,
who was probably of German origin, "who resided in
London, and took a keen interest in everything that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
savoured of intellectual progress."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Hartlib seems,
indeed, first to have heard of Komensk&yacute; as the author
of <i>Janua Linguarum</i>, an educational work that then,
and even long after, enjoyed great celebrity; but he
was principally interested in Komensk&yacute;'s philosophical
studies. Hartlib entered into correspondence with him,
requested information on the subject of "pansophy,"
and offered pecuniary assistance should Komensk&yacute; wish
to visit England.</p>

<p>The latter seems to have received these proposals
favourably, and he forwarded to Hartlib a sketch describing
all the pansophic works he intended to write.
Many of these works perished afterwards when the town
of Lissa was burnt down, and it is therefore a mere
matter of conjecture how many of them already were
in existence. It is, however, certain that Komensk&yacute; at
that time had already compiled a complete table of
contents of his pansophic works under the name of
<i>Synopsis Operis Consultatorii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Hartlib appears to have
been delighted with Komensk&yacute;'s communication, and,
contrary to the author's wishes, he published his pansophic
sketch at Oxford in 1637.</p>

<p>Komensk&yacute; does not seem to have resented this breach
of faith. He had perhaps already made up his mind to visit
England, where the publication of his work was likely to
increase his fame. Disputes with other ministers of the
Unity, who disapproved of Komensk&yacute;'s visionary opinions,
had rendered residence at Lissa distasteful to him. The
death of Count Lescynski in 1637 was also a reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>for leaving Lissa, though his son and successor, Count
Bohnslav Lescynski,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> continued to afford protection to
the brethren even after he had adopted the Roman
faith.</p>

<p>In the year 1641 Komensk&yacute; started for England,
and, after a very perilous journey, during which his
vessel was once driven near to the Norwegian coast and
he was once nearly shipwrecked, he arrived in London
on September 21st of that year. The description of the
perils of the sea, which Komensk&yacute; introduced into the
later editions of the <i>Labyrinth</i>, is founded on these personal
experiences. Of the small coterie that welcomed
Komensk&yacute; in London, Mr. Keatinge gives the following
interesting account. "Komensk&yacute;," he writes, "was
received with open arms by the little band, of which
Hartlib was the centre. A man of great enthusiasm but
less judgment, Hartlib knew everybody in England who
was worth knowing.... At that time in easy circumstances,
he was living in Duke's Place, Drury Lane, an
address which, we may be sure, was the centre of
Komensk&yacute;'s London experiences. Here would have
met to discuss the intellectual and political problems of
the day men like Theodore Haak, John Durie, John
Beale, John Wilkins, John Pell, and Evelyn, who had
just returned to London after a three months' journey
through Europe. Milton was living in London, and
must certainly have met and conversed with the illustrious
stranger."</p>

<p>Komensk&yacute;'s impressions of England are contained in
an interesting letter which, shortly after his arrival on
the 18th (old style 8th) of October 1641, he addressed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>his friends at Lissa.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> After describing his journey and
the kind reception given to him by his English friends,
Komensk&yacute; writes: "What, after having now spent
nearly a month here, I have been able to see, hear, and
understand, I will briefly report, dealing first with public
affairs and then with my own.</p>

<p>"This nook of the earth has much that differs from
other countries, and is worthy of admiration. What
interests me most are those matters which concern the
glory of God and the flourishing state of the Church and
the schools (both now and, it is to be hoped, yet more in
the future).</p>

<p>"If I enumerate some points specially, I know it will
not be displeasing to you and to the friends of God.</p>

<p>"I.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The ardour with which the people crowd to the
churches is incredible. The town has 120 parish
churches, and in all of them&mdash;of all those which I
have visited, I state this as an ascertained fact&mdash;there is
such a crowd that space is insufficient.</p>

<p>"II. Almost all bring a copy of the Bible with them....
Therefore the preacher, when reading his text, twice
mentions book, chapter, and verse. If the text is short
(for he often chooses a single line), he reads it twice
over also.</p>

<p>"III. Of the youths and men, a large number copy
out the sermons word by word with their pens. For
here, thirty years ago (under King James), they discovered
an art which now even the uneducated practise,
that of 'tachygraphia,' which they call stenography....</p>

<p>"IV. After the sermons, most fathers of families repeat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>the sermon at home with the members of their household.
Sometimes two or three families meet for this
purpose.</p>

<p>"Of books on all subjects in their own language they
have an enormous number, so that I doubt whether any
country is equal to them, particularly as regards books
on theology. There are truly not more bookstalls at
Frankfurt at the time of the fair than there are here
every day. Verulamius's (Bacon's) work <i>De Scientiarum</i>
<i>Augmentis</i> has also recently appeared in English.</p>

<p>"VI. Their thirst for the word of God is so great, that
many of the nobles, citizens also and matrons, study
Greek and Hebrew to be able more safely and more
sweetly to drink from the very spring of life. Do not
think that only one or two do this; there are many, and
day by day this holy contagion spreads farther.</p>

<p>"VII. Some select men designated by Parliament are
now working that they may have the text of the Bible as
accurate as possible, corresponding in everything with
the sources, and furnished with very short marginal
notes. Here, however, political considerations have
somewhat interfered, for they have fixed them a term
of a few months only; but I hope the time will be
prolonged.</p>

<p>"VIII. They are vehemently debating on the reform
of the schools of the whole kingdom in a manner similar
to that to which, as you know, my wishes tend, that is, that
all young people should be instructed, none neglected,
and that their instruction should be such that it lay
down the foundations of Christianity more deeply and
more solidly in the tender minds, thus afterwards rendering
greater the efficacy of religious ministration.</p>

<p>"IX. They are endeavouring to found a special illus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>trious
school&mdash;whether in London or elsewhere has not
yet been settled&mdash;for young men of noble birth, separated
from all mixture with plebeians.</p>

<p>"X. An instruction for parents as to the provident
care of their children in infancy and their wise preparation
for further culture in accordance with my <i>Instruction</i><a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> ...
had been prepared here before I arrived...."</p>

<p>Paragraphs XI. and XII. have little interest, but the
last part of the letter, which deals with the political
situation of England, and reflects, no doubt, the opinions
of Komensk&yacute;'s English friends, is worth quoting. Paragraph
XIII. begins thus: "The questions concerning
episcopal rank give much trouble here; some wish to
preserve it in its entire former dignity, others to abolish
entirely both the name and the office; others again wish
to retain the episcopal name and office, but to suppress
the worldly pomp, the too great luxury and the uncalled-for
interference in temporal matters, which are too often
the results of the episcopal system. The larger part of
the nobles, however, and almost all the people, desire
the complete suppression (of the episcopal rank); so
hated has the whole order of bishops become because of
the abuse of their office, and because of their endeavours
to rule men's consciences and oppose the liberty of the
people. Even our own Bishop of Lincoln (of bishops
the most learned, the most cultivated, and politically the
most sagacious), who was three years ago deprived of
his office by the Archbishop, imprisoned, but then liberated
by Parliament, is beginning to be badly spoken of,
and there are some who predict evil for him. They
say he will not only be deprived of his office together
with the other bishops, but also that he will again be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>imprisoned. For new plots against the Parliament have been
discovered, some secret, some almost open. But I hope
and believe in better things for the good bishop. When,
the other day, he invited me as well as Dur&aelig;us (Durie)
and Hartlib to dine and discuss with him, he spoke most
reservedly on all these matters. He only remarked that
he did not know whether he and his colleagues should be
reckoned among the dead or among the living. Should
things take a more peaceful turn, he promised great aid
to us and to ours....</p>

<p>"XIV. Archbishop Laud is detained in prison, with
no hope of liberation. For while Parliament is prorogued,
commissioners have been appointed who will
inquire into his acts and be informed of the various
grievances against him, which Parliament had not time
to hear. This has been done. They also say that such
matters have been produced that there is no hope for
his life.</p>

<p>"XV. The decision of the Parliament, published before
its prorogation, which decreed the removal from all
churches of such 'articles of ceremony' as altars, crosses,
&amp;c., which had been introduced by the Archbishop, has
within the last days been carried out almost everywhere,
In one of the churches here in London there was a window,
the religious and very artistic painting of which,
they say, cost &pound;4000, that is 16,000 imperials. The ambassador
of the Spanish king who resides here offered
to pay the whole of this sum if he could have the window
intact. But the somewhat exaggerated zeal of the
people despised the proffered money and broke the
window, considering that it was wrong to obtain gain
by means of idolatrous objects."</p>

<p>Komensk&yacute;'s visit to England was, like so many of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
undertakings, a complete failure. He seems indeed to
have realised this soon, and to have acquired in a short
time a considerable insight into the state of affairs in
England. Komensk&yacute;'s plan of founding a "Christian
Academy of Pansophy" was at best absurd, but it was
doubly so at a moment when England was drifting
rapidly towards civil war. Quite at first, however,
Komensk&yacute; appears to have believed in the feasibility of
his favourite plan, and he even meditated whether "the
Savoy in London, Winchester, outside of London, or
Chelsea, very near the capital, would be the best site for
the academy." The question naturally arises, What was
the object of the academy that Komensk&yacute;, Hartlib, and
other enthusiasts planned? Mr. Keatinge suggests that
the academy had no further purpose than "to organise
a collection of laboratories for physical research." This,
though undoubtedly part of the plan, was certainly not
the whole plan. The academy, according to Komensk&yacute;,
was to be composed of the wisest men of all countries,
who, among many other things, were to elaborate a universal
language. They were to meet in England "because
of the heroic deeds of the Englishman Drake, who
by five times circumnavigating the world furnished, as
it were, a prelude to the future holy unity of all nations."
Komensk&yacute;'s plans are so obviously utopian that it is
scarcely necessary to mention that they came to nothing.
An universal language will never be accepted, and universal
peace, or the "holy unity of all nations," as Komensk&yacute;
termed it&mdash;though the events of the last few
months prove that that ideal still has believers&mdash;was
certainly impossible in Komensk&yacute;'s time, and probably
will continue an impossibility.</p>

<p>Though long convinced that his fantastic plans found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
little favour in England, Komensk&yacute; yet remained in
London up to June 1642. He here wrote, for the benefit
of Hartlib and his other English friends, his <i>Via Lucis</i>,
in which millenarian views are very noticeable.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival in London, Komensk&yacute; had received
a letter from Louis de Geers, a rich Dutch
merchant, who had important business connections with
Sweden. He had already entered into correspondence
before, and the letter of De Geers was forwarded to
Komensk&yacute; from Lissa. De Geers in his letter suggested
that Komensk&yacute; should proceed to Sweden for the purpose
of reorganising the schools of that country according
to his new educational theories. It is a proof how
soon he had lost his hope in English aid for his pansophic
plans that in November 1641 Komensk&yacute; already
conditionally accepted the offer of De Geers. The
latter had really thought of Komensk&yacute; only as a man
who was already an authority on matters of education;
but Komensk&yacute; himself, sanguine as ever, saw in
a visit to Sweden an opportunity of expounding his
pansophic views to the Chancellor Oxenstiern, and
also&mdash;a more sensible object&mdash;of enlisting the sympathies
of the Swedish statesman for the Bohemian exiles.</p>

<p>In June 1642 Komensk&yacute; left England, and first proceeded
to Holland. It is a proof of the great celebrity
that he had already attained that he here received yet
another invitation. While travelling in Holland, Komensk&yacute;
met Richard Charles Winthrop, formerly Governor
of Massachusetts, who suggested to him that he should
proceed to America and become rector of Harvard College,
that had been founded six years before. Komensk&yacute;,
who was bound by his agreement with the Swedish
Government, in the name of which De Geers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
negotiated with him, declined the offer. In September
1642 Komensk&yacute; arrived in Sweden, had an interview
with De Geers, and afterwards at Stockholm met the
Chancellor Oxenstiern. Komensk&yacute; has left a detailed
and very interesting account of the latter interview, from
which want of space unfortunately prevents my quoting.
Komensk&yacute;, of course, laid great stress on his visionary
views and on his "pansophic"&mdash;philosophical one
can hardly call them&mdash;writings. The great Chancellor,
on the other hand, warmly praised Komensk&yacute;'s educational
works, and suggested, as De Geers had already
done, that he should write a series of Latin school-books
for the use of the Swedish schools. With characteristic
tact, Oxenstiern remarked that if he facilitated
the study of the Latin language, Komensk&yacute; would
prepare the way to further more profound studies. As
Komensk&yacute; refused to remain in Sweden, it was decided
that he should settle at Elbing, in Prussia, not very
far from Sweden.</p>

<p>Komensk&yacute; spent six years (1642-1648) at Elbing,
occupied partly with the preparation of the school-books
he had been commissioned to write, partly with
his favourite "pansophic" studies. His life here, as
almost everywhere, was a troubled one. The agents of
the Swedish Government urged him, in a manner that
was not always delicate, to proceed with the task he
had accepted and not to waste his time on works of
a different nature. On the other hand, Hartlib, with
the characteristic inability of a rich man to understand
that others have to work for their living, bitterly reproached
Komensk&yacute; with having abandoned the sublime
works that had been planned in London for the purpose
of writing school-books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1648, on the death of Bishop Justinus, the members
of the Unity assembled at Lissa chose Komensk&yacute; as one
of their bishops. He outlived all his colleagues, and
eventually became the last bishop of the Bohemian
Brethren. On receipt of the news of his election,
Komensk&yacute; started for Lissa, but not until he had forwarded
to Sweden some of the school-books which
he had been commissioned to write. The year 1648
brought a great blow to the members of the Unity and
to the Bohemian Protestants generally. The Treaty of
Westphalia was signed in that year, and no stipulations
in favour of the Bohemian exiles were contained in it.
At the risk of prolonging the war, the Austrian Government
maintained its principle that no one who did not
profess the creed of Rome should be allowed to reside
in Bohemia or Moravia; to Silesia slight concessions
were granted. All the hopes of the exiles that they
might once be able to return to their beloved Bohemia
were now destroyed for ever. Oxenstiern had to the
last defended the cause of the exiles, and did not deserve
the severe reproaches that Komensk&yacute; addressed
to him.</p>

<p>All hopes of worldly aid having vanished, Komensk&yacute;
relied more than ever on the intervention of God, and
on the visions and prophecies which announced that
such an intervention would shortly take place. "If
there is no aid from man," he wrote to Oxenstiern,
"there will be from God, whose aid is wont to commence
when that of men ceases." Komensk&yacute;'s relations
with Kotter and Ponatovsk&aacute; prove sufficiently that it was
not now that mysticism and credulity first obscured his
generally clear brain; but it is evident that Komensk&yacute;
never quite recovered from the blow inflicted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Treaty of Westphalia, which to his generally optimistic
nature appeared unexpected. His reliance even on the
prophecies of an impudent liar and humbug such as
Drabik injured his reputation in the learned world, and
threw obloquy even on his masterly, wise, and perfectly
sane educational works.</p>

<p>Ever restless, Komensk&yacute; was not prevented, even by
the responsibilities of his new dignity, from undertaking
new wanderings. It has already been mentioned that
when the members of the Unity were expelled from
Bohemia many brethren sought refuge in Hungary.
They now complained that for many years they had not
seen their brother Komensk&yacute;, who had meanwhile acquired
such celebrity. Komensk&yacute; was already meditating
a visit to Hungary when he received a letter from
George Rakoczy, prince of Transylvania, inviting him to
visit his domains, and to introduce there the educational
reforms which had rendered him celebrated. Rakoczy
then ruled not only over Transylvania, but also over a
considerable part of Northern Hungary, including the
towns of Tokay and Saros Patak; the latter of these
towns was indeed a frequent residence of the Transylvanian
princes. Having obtained the consent of the
other seniors or bishops, Komensk&yacute; in 1650 again set
out on his travels. On his journey he passed through
Puch&ouml;, a small town in Northern Hungary, and assisted
at a meeting of the members of the Unity which took
place there. Among those present was Nicholas Drabik,
a former school-fellow of Komensk&yacute;, who proposed to
accompany him on his farther journey. Drabik had
already some years previously forwarded some "prophecies"
to Komensk&yacute;, and the latter now fell entirely
under his influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>It is with pity and shame that I refer to Drabik's
prophecies in connection with so great and good a man
as Komensk&yacute;; their value was about the same as that of
the political predictions of a third-rate writer of leading
articles; the style is a vile imitation of that of the Revelation
of St. John. The leading idea is the destruction of
the House of Austria, which is described as the <i>bestia</i>
of the Apocalypse. The nations that were to effect this
downfall varied in the predictions according to the
political situation of the day. Turkey was then almost
always at war with the House of Habsburg, and therefore
always figured among these nations. At this moment
Drabik announced that he had just had a vision informing
him that enemies coming from four directions
were surrounding "the beast." They were the princes
of the House of Rakoczy, "the dearest instruments of
God," from the east; the Greeks and Servians from the
south; the Poles, Lithuanians, Russians, Tartars, and
Turks from the north; the Swiss from the west! The
Hungarian crown was assured to Sigismund Rakoczy,
at whose expense Drabik was then living. Komensk&yacute;,
who had received former "prophecies," ventured to remark
that in them the crown of Hungary had been
assured to Sigismund's father, Prince George Rakoczy
(who had died in 1648). Drabik then "burst out into
tears," and thus pacified the kind-hearted Komensk&yacute;. It
may incidentally be remarked, that when Prince Sigismund
died in 1652, Drabik again calmly transferred his
prophecy, this time to that prince's brother and successor,
George II. of Transylvania. While Kotter may have
believed in his visions, and physical circumstances probably
explain those of Ponatovsk&aacute;, Drabik was simply
an impostor, who managed not only to live at free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
quarters, but also to obtain considerable sums of money
as a remuneration for alleged negotiations with Turkey.
It was indeed through him that Komensk&yacute;, who was
integrity personified, was at Saros Patak accused of
indelicacy in financial matters and of greediness for
money. These accusations were afterwards echoed by
the divines with whom Komensk&yacute; was engaged in controversies
during the last years of his life, and they also
found their way into Bayle's <i>Dictionnaire Historique et</i>
<i>Critique</i>.</p>

<p>It must be sufficient to note the enormous influence
Drabik acquired over Komensk&yacute;; to account for it is
impossible, unless we assume that much suffering and
disappointment had weakened his intellect. This is,
however, disproved by the fact that the educational
works which Komensk&yacute; continued to write nearly to
the end of his life show little trace of waning mental
power. It must be taken into account, also, that visions
and prophecies found very general belief in those days.
Mr. Keatinge, in his interesting book to which I have
already referred, mentions several instances of learned
Englishmen who had read the prophecies of Drabik (or
Drabicius, as he was called in England), and fully believed
in them. Bayle also writes that when, in 1683,
the news that the Turks were besieging Vienna reached
Paris, the name of the prophet Drabik was in every
mouth. Drabik at last came to an evil end. A few
months (fortunately) after Komensk&yacute;'s death, Drabik was
arrested as a swindler and conspirator. He confessed his
impostures and was executed, though he had accepted
the creed of Rome in the hope of saving his life.</p>

<p>Komensk&yacute;'s activity as a teacher while at Saros Patak
was indefatigable. He attempted to improve and re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>organise
the "gymnasium" of the town, and also wrote
several new educational works during his stay in Hungary.
He encountered, however, many obstacles; the
local teachers were opposed to him, and reproached him
with his intimacy with Drabik; linguistic difficulties also
arose. If Komensk&yacute; yet remained four years in Hungary,
it was mainly for political purposes. He still hoped to
contribute to the formation of a Protestant League which
would drive the Austrians out of Bohemia, and thus
enable the brethren to return to their beloved country.
Komensk&yacute; now hoped for aid from England, since Cromwell
was famed all over the Continent as the protector
of persecuted Protestants. After the death of Sigismund
Rakoczy, Komensk&yacute; actually succeeded in inducing his
brother and successor, George II., to endeavour to
negotiate an alliance with England and Sweden against
Austria. When the Transylvanian embassy started for
London, it was instructed to pass by Lissa to consult
with Komensk&yacute;, who had already returned to Poland.
His knowledge of English affairs would, it was thought,
prove useful, and it is probable that the state paper
which the ambassadors presented to Cromwell was from
the pen of Komensk&yacute;. Komensk&yacute;, indeed, always seems
to have continued to communicate with his English
friends. As late as in 1658, Cromwell and Thurloe, no
doubt through the intermediation of Hartlib, suggested
that the Bohemian Brethren, together with the Vaudois
or Waldenses, whom the Duke of Savoy was then persecuting,
should be established in Ireland. Lands
formerly belonging to Roman Catholics were to have
been given to them, and it was thought that the Protestant
element in Ireland would thus be strengthened.
Komensk&yacute;, perhaps injudiciously, declined the proposal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
He stated, either in consequence of his own conviction
or because of his belief in the wretched Drabik's prophecies,
that the brethren would shortly return to their
own country, and therefore could not travel to distant
lands.</p>

<p>In 1654 Komensk&yacute; returned to Lissa, but his stay
there was now short and troubled. War between
Sweden and Poland broke out in the following year,
and the victorious Swedes occupied Lissa in August
1655. The only policy for the homeless community of
the brethren evidently was to remain neutral in these
alien quarrels. Unfortunately, Komensk&yacute; employed his
ever-ready pen in composing a panegyric on Charles
Gustavus, the victorious Swedish king. In the following
year the town of Lissa was retaken by the Polish army,
pillaged, and burnt down. Komensk&yacute;'s library and his
MS. were again destroyed. The brethren, perhaps not
without reason, accused Komensk&yacute; of having, through
his injudicious writings, caused the downfall of the
community of Lissa, to which the Poles had never been
hostile before.</p>

<p>Komensk&yacute;, now sixty-five years old, was again homeless,
and he was at first uncertain where he should
seek refuge. He proceeded to Hamburg, but there received
an invitation to Amsterdam from Lawrence De
Geers, the son of his old patron Louis De Geers.
Komensk&yacute; started for Amsterdam, and here spent the
latest years of his life. His literary activity continued to
the last. He published at Amsterdam the only complete
edition of his educational works, and even wrote
new "pansophic" books. Differing on this point from
his father, Lawrence De Geers took great interest in
these studies, and even in the writings of the "prophets,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
in whom Komensk&yacute; obstinately continued to believe.
De Geers was foolish enough to invite Drabik to
Amsterdam, and it was through his financial aid that
Komensk&yacute; was enabled to publish in 1657 his <i>Lux in</i>
<i>Tenebris</i>, a book in which all the prophecies of Kotter,
Ponatovsk&aacute;, and Drabik were again brought before the
public.</p>

<p>The mystic and now openly professed chiliastic views
of Komensk&yacute; involved him during the last years of his
life in numerous theological controversies. Detailed accounts
of them have recently been published in Bohemian,
perhaps rather because everything concerned with
Komensk&yacute; is valued by his countrymen than because these
controversies now have much interest. Among Komensk&yacute;'s
theological antagonists were Nicholas Arnold, Daniel
Zwicker, and Samuel Des Marets, a professor at Gr&ouml;ningen.
The last-named attacked the aged bishop of the
Unity with great violence, calling him "a fanatic, a
visionary, and an enthusiast in folio." He also accused
him of obtaining large sums from the De Geers family
by means of "pansophic hope and chiliastic smoke." A
polemical essay directed against Descartes also belongs
to Komensk&yacute;'s last years. These years were very melancholy,
though the old man, characteristically enough,
found great relief in the society of an aged French prophetess
and visionist named Antoinette Bourgignon. His
old comrades died off one by one. Of the bishops of
the community, Gertichius died in 1667, and Figulus
(Komensk&yacute;'s son-in-law) in January 1670. In the same
year, on November 15th, Komensk&yacute;, the last bishop of
the Bohemian Brethren, ended his long and troubled
life.</p>

<p>It would require a book larger than the whole of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
volume to give even a slight account of the 142 works<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
of Komensk&yacute;. Such a book would hardly have much
general interest. The enormous total includes prayer-books,
lists of regulations for the Unity, mere school-books,
sermons, works on natural history that long since
have become valueless, and so on. These lists, however,
which include only books that are still in existence, do
not comprise the entire fruits of the literary activity of
Komensk&yacute;. Several "pansophic" works that are enumerated
in a table of contents, to which I have already
referred, are no longer in existence, and were probably
destroyed when the town of Lissa was burnt down.</p>

<p>While at Fulneck, Komensk&yacute; was already busy writing
works on grammar as well as a Bohemian translation of
the Psalms. The melancholy events of the year 1621,
when he lost his wife and his home at Fulneck and began
his many wanderings, inspired him to write several
religious books, all bearing witness to the deep depression
of the author. Such works are the <i>Help for the Soul</i>,
<i>The Impregnable Castle, which is the Name of the Lord</i>,
<i>The Dismal Complaint of a Christian</i>, <i>The Centre of</i>
<i>Security</i>, and others. All these writings are in Bohemian,
as also is the far better known <i>Labyrinth</i>, which
Komensk&yacute; wrote at Brandeis-on-the-Adler shortly after
his arrival there, and dedicated to his patron, Lord
Charles of &#381;erotin. The <i>Labyrinth of the World</i>, perhaps
one of the best allegorical narratives that has ever been
written, professes the same pessimism, combined with a
fervent belief in the revelations of the Christian faith,
which can be found in the other works also which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>have just mentioned. The <i>Labyrinth</i> from its first
appearance obtained an immense popularity with the
Bohemian people,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> to which I have already referred.
Since the Bohemians have again been able to read freely
the records of their ancient literature, the <i>Labyrinth</i> has
regained its former popularity, as is proved by the
numerous recently published editions.</p>

<p>The <i>Labyrinth of the World</i>, written in Komensk&yacute;'s
youth, is, from a literary point of view, undoubtedly his
greatest achievement. Rarely perhaps has the vanity of
all worldly matters, the hopelessness of men's struggles,
the inevitable disappointment which is the result of even
the most successful ambition, been more clearly expounded
than in this small and unknown work. Were
we not constantly reminded that we are reading the
book of a devout Christian and member of the Unity, we
should fancy that we were reading the work of a forerunner
of Schopenhauer. Komensk&yacute;'s <i>Labyrinth</i>, in fact,
reeks with pessimism, though his admirable religious
faith and piety enabled him to give a supernatural and
consolatory ending to his book. Happiness, unattainable
here, is to be found elsewhere.</p>

<p>The little book is well worth being translated into
English, and I hope some day to attempt that task.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> It
will here only be possible to give an outline of the tale
and a few quotations. Komensk&yacute; tells us of the adventures
of a young man who, "when arrived at that age
when the human mind begins to understand the difference
between good and evil, sees how various are men's
stations and ranks, their vocations, and the works and
undertakings which occupy them." He then meditates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>as to "what group of men he should join, and with what
subjects he should occupy his life." The youth then
starts on his wanderings, having accepted "Impudence"
and "Falsehood" as his guides. They conduct him to
the summit of a high tower. He now beholds a city
which appeared to him "beautiful, splendid, and broad,
with countless streets, squares, houses, smaller and larger
buildings, all swarming with people." The six principal
streets, his companions tell him, are inhabited respectively
by married people, tradesmen, scholars, priests,
rulers, and soldiers. To the west of the city he is shown
the "Castle of Fortune." In the middle of the city is a
vast square, in the centre of which is the residence of
the "Queen of Wisdom." The pilgrim is then shown
two gates: the first, that of life, through which all must
pass; the second, that of separation. Before entering
this gate, all must draw lots and accept a career in the
world in accordance with the lot they have drawn. They
arrive at the gates of separation, and then the pilgrim, or
rather Komensk&yacute;, tells us: "We went downward by a
dark winding staircase, and before the door there was a
wide hall full of young people, and on the right side
there sat a fierce-looking old man, holding in his hand a
large copper jar. And I saw that all those who came from
the gate of life stepped up to him, and each one put his
hand into the jar and drew from it a scrap of paper on
which something was written. Then each of them went
down one of the streets, some running and shouting
from joy, while others crept along slowly, looked around
them, groaned and lamented.</p>

<p>"I also then came nearer, looked at some of the
scraps of paper, and noticed that one contained the
word 'Rule!' another 'Serve!' another 'Command!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
another 'Write!' another 'Plough!' another 'Learn!'
another 'Dig!' another 'Judge!' yet another 'Fight!'
and so forth. Impudence said to me: 'Here vocations
and work are distributed, and according to this distribution
every one has to fulfil his task in the world. He
who distributes the lots is called Fate, and from him in
this fashion every one who enters the world must receive
his instructions.'</p>

<p>"Then Falsehood nudged me at my other side, thus
giving me notice that I also should stretch out my hand.
I begged not to be obliged to take any one lot directly
without first examining it, nor to intrust myself to blind
fortune. But I was told that without the permission of
the Lord Regent Fate this could not be. Then stepping
up to him, I modestly brought forward my request, saying
that I had arrived with the intention of seeing everything
for myself, and only then choosing what pleased me."
"He answered: 'My son, you see that others do not
this, but what is given or offered them they take. However,
as you desire this, it is well!' Then he wrote on a
scrap of paper, 'Speculare,' that is to say, 'Look round
you or inquire,' gave it to me and left me."</p>

<p>The pilgrim and his two companions now enter the
city, and proceed first to the street of the married people.
Here Komensk&yacute; gives us what, for one who was married
three times, and is not known to have been unhappy in
marriage, seems an intensely gloomy and pessimistic
view of married life. He dilates on the uncertainty of
choice in marriage, on the trouble caused by children,
on the disappointment felt by the childless, on all that
is unlovely in love. The pilgrim then proceeds to the
street of the tradesmen, and the many troubles, anxieties,
and disappointments to which commerce is exposed are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
eloquently described. Komensk&yacute;, in the later editions
of the <i>Labyrinth</i>, here inserted a curious passage referring
to his own sea-voyage, from which I can only quote
a few lines. "The wind," he writes, "had meanwhile
increased so rapidly that we were tossed about in a
manner that horrified our hearts; the sea rolled round
us in every direction with such gigantic waves that our
course was, as it were, up high hills and down deep
valleys, once upward and then again downward; sometimes
we were shot upwards to such heights that it
seemed as if we were to reach the moon, then again we
descended as into a precipice.... This continued day
and night, and any one can imagine what anguish and
fear we felt. Then I said to myself, 'Surely these men
(the sailors) must be more pious than all other men, they
who never for an hour are sure of their lives;' but looking
at them, I observed that they were all without exception
eating gluttonously, as in a tavern, drinking, playing,
laughing, talking in an obscene manner, in fact,
committing every sort of evil deed and licentiousness."</p>

<p>The pilgrim next visits the scholars or learned men.
Komensk&yacute;, here quite in his element, passes judgment
on many <i>savants</i> of his time, and gives his opinion on
astronomy, history, natural history, poetry, and philosophy
as they appeared to him in the writings of his contemporaries.
His erudition, judged, of course, by the
standard of his time, does not appear profound, but he
sometimes, in few words, describes epigrammatically currents
of thought that had importance in his day.</p>

<p>The chapters which deal with the priesthood are
closely connected with those that tell us of the pilgrim's
visit to the men of learning. As Komensk&yacute; had, when
describing the former, laid stress on the many follies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
philosophers and the vanity of human learning, he now
deals severely with the professed teachers of religious
truth, noting their obstinacy, their want of erudition,
their constant reciprocal animosities.</p>

<p>The pilgrim and his companions now proceed to the
street of the rulers. Here, in accordance with the pessimistic
note which characterises the book, we are told
that all earthly authority is evil, but that if it did not
exist, the condition of the world would be yet worse.
We here find interesting allusions to contemporary
events, the sudden appearance and downfall of King
Frederick of Bohemia and the executions at Prague in
1621. Komensk&yacute; lays stress on the uncertainty of royal
power. He writes: "Then the royal throne (that of
Ferdinand of Austria is meant) suddenly shook, broke
into bits, and fell to the ground. Then I heard noise
among the people, and looking round, I saw that they
were leading in another prince and seating him on the
throne, while they joyously exclaimed that things would
now be different from what they were. They flatter
the new prince and all who can strengthen the throne
for him to sit on. I, thinking it right to act for
the advantage of the general welfare, also contributed
a nail or two to strengthen the throne; for this
some praised me, while others looked at me with disapproval.
But meanwhile the other prince recovered
himself, and he and his men attacked us with cudgels,
thrashing the whole crowd till they fled, and many even
lost their necks." Komensk&yacute; here alludes to some service
which he had rendered to the government of King
Frederick, of which nothing is otherwise known. He no
doubt sympathised with that government and was on
terms of acquaintance with administrators of the Utra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>quist
Consistory of Prague. One of the administrators,
Cyrillus, who assisted the president, Dicastus, at the
coronation of King Frederick, was the father of Komensk&yacute;'s
second wife, whom he married about the time
when he wrote the <i>Labyrinth</i>.</p>

<p>After the rulers, the pilgrim visits the soldiers. Komensk&yacute;
here gives a very lifelike description of the brutal
ways of the soldiery at the time of the Thirty Years' War.
His battle-picture is also striking. "Then suddenly," he
writes, "the drums beat, the trumpet resounds, noisy cries
arise. Then, behold, all rise up, seize daggers, cutlasses,
bayonets, or whatever they have, and strike unmercifully
at one another till blood spirts out. They hack and hew
at one another worse than the most savage animals. Then
in every direction the cries increased; one could hear
the tramping of horses, the clashing of armour, the
clattering of swords, the growl of the artillery, the
whistle of shots and bullets round our ears, the sound
of trumpets, the crash of drums, the cries of those who
urged on the soldiers, the shouting of the victors, the
shrieking of the wounded and dying; an awful leaden
hailstorm could be seen, fearful fiery thunder and
lightning could be heard; now this, now that man's
arm, head, leg, flew away; there one fell over another;
everything swam in blood! 'Almighty God!' said I,
'what is happening? Must the whole world perish?'"</p>

<p>The pilgrim now tells his companions that he has
everywhere found but vanity. They answer him by
informing him that those who have laboured hard eventually
find their way to the castle of Fortune, where
happiness, honour, and pleasure await them. The pilgrim
is now conducted to this castle, but here also finds
nothing that attracts him. He reflects on the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
cares that are the consequence of riches, the misery that
ever threatens libertines, gamblers, and gluttons, the
vanity of glory and of ancient lineage. The pilgrim's
guides, uncertain what to do with him, now lead him
to the castle of the goddess of Worldly Wisdom. They
bring him before the goddess and thus accuse him:
"Most serene queen of the world," they say, "most
brilliant ray of God's light, magnificent Wisdom! The
young man whom we bring before you has had the
fortune to receive from Fate (the regent of your Majesty)
the permission to view all the ranks and conditions in
this kingdom of the world.... But he always complains
to us of everything; everything displeases him;
he is always striving for something that is unattainable.
Therefore we cannot satisfy his wild cravings nor understand
them, and we bring him before your serene grace,
and leave it to your prudence to decide what is to be
done with him."</p>

<p>The queen receives the pilgrim graciously and invites
him to remain at her court. Shortly afterwards Solomon
appears at the queen's court with the intention of wedding
her. He is accompanied by a large crowd of
courtiers, among whom are Socrates, Plato, Epictetus,
Seneca, many Christians and Jews. In their presence
the queen receives numerous deputations, all bringing
petitions, beggars, philosophers, who are represented by
Theophrastus and Aristotle, judges, lawyers, and others.
At last the queen receives a deputation of women. They
state that it would be fair that they and men should
alternately have dominion. Some even say that they
alone should rule, as their bodies are more agile and
their minds quicker than those of men. As men for so
many years have ruled women, it is, they say, time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
women should take superior rank. A few years ago,
they add, a noble example of this was given in the
kingdom of England under the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
for she decreed that all men should give their right hand
to women, a worthy custom that still endured.</p>

<p>Solomon, who had hitherto listened attentively to the
petitions and to the queen's answers, now suddenly
exclaims, "Vanity of vanities, and everything is vanity."
He then tears away the mask which the queen wore, and
she appears as a hideous hag. Yet shortly afterwards
Solomon is, by means of flattery, again won over to her
side and conducted to the street of married people, where
he is unable to resist the female attractions that offer
themselves to him. Fearful calamities are the consequence
of Solomon's weakness, and the pilgrim despairingly
exclaims, "Oh, that I had never been born, never
passed through the gate of life! for after having surveyed
all the vanities of the world, nothing but darkness and
horror are my part. O God, God! If thou art a God,
have mercy on wretched me!" The pilgrim, whom his
companions have meanwhile abandoned, now hears a
voice from on high which exclaims, "Return whence
thou camest into the house of thy heart, and then close
the doors." The voice is that of Christ, who appears to
the pilgrim and instructs him in true religion; the teaching,
needless to say, is strictly in accordance with the
doctrine of the Unity. The pilgrim is then received into
heaven, and the last chapter consists in a prayer to
Christ, ending with the Latin words, <i>Gloria in excelsis Deo</i>
<i>et in terra pax hominibus bon&aelig; voluntatis</i>.</p>

<p>It is impossible to render justice to the <i>Labyrinth</i> in a
few pages, and no book lends itself less to quotation.
Komensk&yacute;, who is generally diffuse and addicted to repe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>tition,
has here given us an enormous amount of thought
and experience in a very small volume.</p>

<p>The great educational works of Komensk&yacute;, on which
his principal claim to posthumous fame is founded, but
which do not perhaps require lengthy mention in a work
that deals mainly with literature, were principally written
during the author's first prolonged stay at Lissa. Though
the order in which Komensk&yacute;'s educational works were
written cannot always be ascertained with certainty, there
is little doubt that one of the earliest was the <i>Informatorium</i>
<i>&#352;koly Mate&#345;sk&eacute;</i> (= instruction for mother-schools).<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> It
first appeared in Bohemian in 1628. The little book deals
with the earliest instruction which a child receives from
its mother. It soon obtained great popularity, and was
speedily translated into German, Latin, and English.
Anticipating Rousseau, Komensk&yacute; lays great stress on
the duty of mothers to nurse their children. The
<i>Instruction for Mother-Schools</i> is still much read in
Bohemia, and some of the regulations contained in it
have been adopted for the modern "Kindergarten."
Many other educational works of Komensk&yacute; appeared
in rapid succession during his stay at Lissa. The most
valuable of them is the <i>Didactica Magna</i>, which, like the
<i>Informatorium</i>, was originally written and first published
in Bohemian. Komensk&yacute; here establishes four degrees
of education: the mother-school, the vernacular school,
the Latin school or gymnasium, and the academy or
university. The earliest education in Germany and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>Austria is, except in the case of the Kindergarten, still
left to the mother's own discretion; but it is interesting
to note that the three other divisions of educational establishments
suggested by Komensk&yacute; are almost exactly in
accordance with the present system of education in these
countries.</p>

<p>It is beyond the purpose of this book to give a detailed
account of Komensk&yacute;'s educational theories. I must
refer those who are interested in the subject to Mr.
Keatinge's excellent introduction to his recently published
English version of the <i>Didactica Magna</i>, which I
have already mentioned. The writer here gives us a
concise but very clear sketch of these theories.</p>

<p>One of the best known, probably formerly the best
known, work of Komensk&yacute; is also of an educational
character. I am referring to the celebrated <i>Janua</i>
<i>Linquarum Reserata</i>, which was first published in 1631.
The book was an attempt&mdash;somewhat anticipating Ollendorf's
method&mdash;of facilitating the study of Latin, and in
the enlarged editions that of other languages as well.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
The book immediately obtained an enormous success,
and was constantly republished even up to the beginning
of the present century. Philology and the science
of languages generally have made such gigantic progress
since Komensk&yacute;'s time that the modern reader
has the impression that the book was immensely overrated.
Komensk&yacute;'s peculiar system of introducing as
many different words as possible, and of avoiding as far
as possible the repetition of a word that had already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>been used, give the book an appearance of artificiality
and constraint. The real leading idea of Komensk&yacute;'s
<i>Janua</i> is an attempt simultaneously to teach a language
and to enlarge as far as possible the extent of the pupil's
ideas. I have elsewhere translated a portion of the
curious chapter <i>De Statu Regio</i>. I shall here quote
the first introductory chapter, which gives some idea
of Komensk&yacute;'s method. It is written in the form of a
dialogue between the reader and the author. The latter
begins thus:&mdash;"Welcome, friendly reader! If you ask
me what it is to be learned, receive this answer: It means
to know the differences between things, and to be able
to name and designate all things by their right names."</p>

<p>The pupil answers, "Nothing more than this?"</p>

<p>"No, certainly nothing beyond this. He who has
learned the nomenclature of all things of Nature and
Art has laid the foundation of all erudition."</p>

<p>"But that must surely be very difficult."</p>

<p>"It certainly is so if you attempt it unwillingly, and
if you allow your prejudiced imagination to frighten
you. Besides, if there is any difficulty, it will be at the
beginning. Do not the shapes and characters of letters
also appear to children who first see them singular,
wonderful, and monstrous? But when they have taken
some trouble and pains, they understand that they (the
letters) are but a play and a recreation. The same
applies to all things; they appear superficially more
difficult than they are. But if you not only begin a
work but also persevere, there is nothing that will not
yield and submit itself to your intellect Who wishes
to do so can understand everything.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Therefore, whoever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>you are, I order you to hope; I forbid you to
despair. See this small work (the <i>Janua</i>). Here&mdash;I
say this without boasting&mdash;I shall place the whole
world before your eyes and show you the Latin, French,
Spanish, Italian, and German languages<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> as in a summary
or handbook. Therefore strive to obtain instruction.
Open this book, peruse it, and learn it by heart
Having done so, you will, with the help of God, find
that you understand all arts and letters."</p>

<p>Many other educational works of Komensk&yacute; could
be enumerated; such are <i>The Violet Bed of Christian</i>
<i>Youth</i>, <i>The Garden of Letters and of Wisdom</i>, &amp;c. Komensk&yacute;
worked with particular energy at these works
when he, about the year 1632, hoped, as already mentioned,
to be able to return to Bohemia and reorganise
the schools there. A similar motive induced him to
write the curious work entitled <i>Hagg&aelig;us Redivivus</i>,
which, in spite of its Latin title, was written in Bohemian,
and which has quite recently been published
for the first time. In this book Komensk&yacute; endeavoured
to instruct the brethren as to the manner in which they
should reorganise their ecclesiastical institution after their
return to Bohemia, for which Komensk&yacute; still hoped.</p>

<p>Komensk&yacute;, probably soon after his arrival at Lissa,
began his philosophical, or rather "pansophic" studies;
for philosophy was to him still the handmaiden of
theology, then already a rather belated standpoint. It
has already been mentioned that at Lissa he composed
a general plan and a table of contents of his future
pansophic works, to which he gave the name of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span><i>Synopsis</i>
<i>Operis Consultatorii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Some of these works, such as the
<i>Panegersia</i> and <i>Panaugia</i>, were afterwards published at
Amsterdam; others were destroyed by the fire at Lissa.
The first complete philosophical work of Komensk&yacute;, the
<i>Physica</i>, was published during his stay at Lissa. The
work has now no interest, and is, indeed, a token of
Komensk&yacute;'s superficiality and credulity as regards matters
of natural history. Statements concerning this subject
are by Komensk&yacute; constantly proved by texts from the
Bible in a manner irritating to the modern reader.</p>

<p>One of the early "pansophic" works also is the <i>Via</i>
<i>Lucis</i>, written principally during Komensk&yacute;'s stay in
London. The pansophic plans, such as the foundation
of a universal language and a universal academy, the
mystic use of the word light, occur in this as in all the
pansophic works. A short account of the <i>Via Lucis</i> will
be my only attempt to elucidate the mysteries of "pansophy."
Arid and unattractive as the subject must
necessarily appear to the modern intellect, no account
that altogether ignored "pansophy" could claim to give
a truthful representation of Komensk&yacute;.</p>

<p>The writer begins his book by naming, in his mystical
manner, the three "books" (that is to say, three systems
of educating humanity) which God has established; they
are instruction by means of the world, by means of man,
and by means of universal "light" (or enlightenment).
Education by means of the world has failed, as worldly
wisdom, atheism, and epicureanism, introduced by Satan,
have crazed men's minds. Instruction from man by
means of laws and punishment, and the endeavours of
philosophers and founders of sects, has also resulted in
failure; all attempts to amend humanity by human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>means have had no result, for they were isolated
and relied on violent means. There remains a third
"school," the only successful one, which instructs by
means of the "universal light." This light, or rather
enlightenment, consists in the complete collection of
God's revelations to man by means of Scripture, which
through God's power will become intelligible to all.
There is no doubt that this "universal light" will one
day appear to the whole world. Komensk&yacute; quotes the
Revelation of St. John in support of this statement. He
then proceeds to define this light, which is "a brightness
that flows on things, discloses and discovers them, and
through the influence of which spectators realise shapes,
positions, movements, the distances of things, and their
reciprocal relations." Light is threefold&mdash;eternal, exterior,
and interior light. Besides the eternal divine
light, there is the exterior light proceeding from the sun
and the stars.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The interior light illuminates the mind,
will, and heart of man. The interior light passes through
seven gradations, the last of which, immediately preceding
the end of the world and to be expected shortly,
is "panharmony." The state of "panharmony" will
be shortly attained, and we must prepare for it. This
should be done mainly by the foundation of a universal
academy, a universal language, and universal schools.
When all this has been done, the whole world will be
"one race, one people, one house, one school of God.
The heathens will be converted. The Jews will perceive
that they are still in darkness. All lands will become
subject to God and Christ. In accordance with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>Revelations and the Acts of the Apostles, Satan will be
taken prisoner and shown in triumph. The whole world
will have peace; (there will be) one truth, one heart, one
path. Thus will Christ's prophecy of 'one shepherd,
one flock' be fulfilled. This will be the true Golden
Age. It will be the Sabbath of the Church, the seventh
period of the world, preceding the octave that will
resound in happy eternity."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The last years of Komensk&yacute; were principally occupied
in collecting, and sometimes re-writing, his works. The
enormous collection of educational books was during
Komensk&yacute;'s stay at Amsterdam republished in Latin
in a gigantic folio volume under the name of <i>Opera</i>
<i>Didactica</i>. The collection included books such as the
<i>Didactica Magna</i>, the <i>Janua</i>, and the <i>Schola Materni</i>
<i>Gremii</i> (information for mother-schools) that had long
before been published in the Bohemian language.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>Other late pansophic works of Komensk&yacute; were the
<i>Lux in Tenebris</i>, consisting mainly of a collection of
prophecies which have already been mentioned, and
the <i>Unum Necessarium</i>, dedicated to Prince Rupert, and
published in 1668.</p>

<p>The writers of the Unity are, during the last century,
so infinitely superior to all others, that little space
remains to mention theologians who belonged to other
communities. The early writers of the Utraquist Church
were mentioned in the last chapter, and I have in this
chapter again referred to Archbishop Rokycan. The
numerous later polemical writings of the Utraquists are
infinitely inferior to the best works of the members of
the Unity, which of course are the only ones to which
I have made reference.</p>

<p>Of Roman Catholic theologians in Bohemia also scant
mention at this period is required. In most countries
the salutary deliberations of the Council of Trent, which
so entirely reorganised and reformed the Catholic
Church, were followed by the appearance of numerous
brilliant Catholic theologians, who, both in their sermons
and their writings, energetically defended the dogmas
of their Church. Such was not the case in Bohemia.
It was the sword, not the pen, that was destined to
reconquer that country for the Church of Rome. Of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>Catholic writers we may mention Paul &#381;idek, a Jew by
birth; Henry Institoris, who was intrusted by Pope
Alexander VI. with the task of recovering Bohemia for
the Church of Rome, and wrote polemical works against
Chel&#269;icky and the brethren; and the barefooted monk,
John of Vodnan, a voluminous writer, who has already
been mentioned as an antagonist of Chel&#269;icky. The
works of Vodnan are an extraordinary tissue of absurdities
written with an almost inconceivable degree of self-confidence.
He maintains theories such as that of the
immaculate conception of the Virgin (then by no means
a dogma of the Roman Church), by arguments and in
a tone that are equally unworthy of the dignity of the
subject. His books teem with the most absurdly superstitious
anecdotes. The Pope, he tells us, is always accompanied
by two special angels, one who advises him on all
occasions, and one who informs him of all occurrences.
A more dignified defender of the Church of Rome was
the Jesuit Wenceslas Sturm (born 1533, died 1601), who
has left a considerable number of theological works,
mostly of a polemical character.</p>

only occasionally that mistakes occur, as when it is stated (on page <a href="#Page_1">1</a> of
the introduction) that the Unity "took a position midway between the Utraquists
and the Roman Catholics." The Utraquists were, on the contrary,
nearest to Rome, and some of them were indeed prepared to accept all its
teaching if the right to receive communion <i>sub utraque</i>, in the two kinds, were
granted them. The Brethren were of all Bohemian reformers most antagonistic
to the Church of Rome, and refused to recognise all institutions which,
according to their views, had not existed in the primitive Church.</p></div>

BOHEMIAN HISTORIANS OF THE SIXTEENTH
AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</h2>


<p>The period subsequent to the Hussite wars was very
favourable to the development of the Bohemian language,
and especially to that of historical studies. The
stirring events of the times directed general interest to
the great political and religious struggle; for these words
are nearly synonymous when we deal with the century
that preceded the battle of the White Mountain (1620),
with which the aspirations of the Bohemians for ecclesiastical
as well as for political independence ended for
a time. The constant references to the Divinity, the
prayers and hymns which are inserted in historical
works of a mainly secular character, prove that in
Bohemia political and religious controversies were at
that period even more closely connected than in other
countries.</p>

<p>Other causes also contributed to the increase of intellectual
activity which we find in Bohemia at the beginning
of the sixteenth century. I have already referred
to the "humanist" movement, which, in consequence of
the religious isolation of Bohemia, reached that country
late, but for a time had the greatest influence on the
intellectual development of the land. I have also already
alluded to the foundation and beginnings of the community
of the Bohemian Brethren, which greatly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>fluenced
the literary as well as the political condition of
Bohemia. The brethren from the first attached great
importance to the study of history, and they had established
archives at Senftenberg, and afterwards at Leitomischl.
A school of writers on history sprung up among
them whose works&mdash;judging by the scanty remains that
have reached us&mdash;possessed both great value and great
beauty of style. The greater part of these works has
been lost long ago. The brethren who constituted
the most advanced fraction of the party which desired
Church reform were naturally most hated and dreaded
by the Jesuits, to whom the return of Bohemia to the
Roman Church must principally be attributed. The
writings of the brethren were thus specially marked out
for destruction. Among the historical works that are
probably irretrievably lost is that which was, according
to all accounts, the most valuable, Blahoslav's <i>History</i>
<i>of the Unity</i>. Yet even the existent works of members
of the brotherhood, such as Bilek, Blahoslav, B&#345;ezan,
&#381;erotin, to speak of historians only, sufficiently vouch
for the high degree of culture which the brethren had
attained. They attached great importance to the
grammar of their language, and many of their works
were, as already recorded, models of Bohemian style.</p>

<p>The political condition of the country also then
favoured the development of the national language,
which was during this period&mdash;and during this period
only&mdash;almost exclusively used by historians. During
the reigns of the kings of the House of Luxemburg the
Bohemian language had to a great extent lost ground.
King John was known to dislike the Bohemian language,
and though this dislike was by no means
shared by his son Charles, yet even the foundation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the University of Prague (though that university afterwards
became a national one) was not at first favourable
to the development of the Bohemian language. It was
at first principally frequented by foreigners, and German
and Latin were almost exclusively used there.</p>

<p>Of the contemporary chroniclers of the Hussite war
many still wrote in Latin. Yet the Hussite movement
undoubtedly favoured the development of the Bohemian
language, if it was only by the isolation from the rest of
the Western world which the religious separation produced.
A great impetus was also given to the cultivation
of the national language by the circumstance that a few
years before the beginning of the sixteenth century (in
1495) the Bohemian law courts decided to carry on their
proceedings in the national language. The law courts
of Silesia and Moravia had already previously substituted
Bohemian for the Latin language, which they had previously
used. Of yet greater importance was the fact
that Bohemian at this period became the language exclusively
used at the "diets" or meetings of the three
"Estates" of Bohemia. In the minds of many Bohemians
the preservation of the national language was closely
connected with the conservation of their political and
ecclesiastical independence. As late as in 1615, only
five years before the final collapse of Bohemia, the Diet
decided that all those who became naturalised Bohemians
should be bound to instruct and educate their children
in the language of the country. It may be noticed that
this fervent devotion to the national language, which has
often astonished foreigners, is a marked feature also in
the revival of Bohemian literature and in the present
nationalist movement.</p>

<p>Among the most recent writers on Bohemian history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
it has become the fashion to depreciate the social and
intellectual condition of Bohemia in the years that preceded
the battle of the White Mountain; they perhaps
endeavour thus to attenuate the sentimental feeling of
regret for the great defeat which a few Bohemians still
cherish. That the political results of the battle of the
White Mountain, which consisted in the establishment
of an absolute but orderly government; were advantageous
to Bohemia, and, indeed, saved the country
from anarchy, is certain. Yet it is no less certain that
nobles and citizens, such as Peter of Rosenberg, Charles
of &#381;erotin, Budovec of Budova (mentioned in the last
chapter), Harant of Pol&#382;ic, Barto&#353; Pis&aacute;&#345;, Sixt of Ottersdorf,
Sk&aacute;la ze Zho&#345;e (who all belong to the sixteenth or
the beginning of the seventeenth century), were intellectually
vastly superior to the men of similar rank and
position who lived a century later, after many years of
absolutist government.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that among the historians of the
period with which I am dealing, the majority are men
who themselves played a part in the political life of
their time. The Bohemians of this period were&mdash;partly,
though by no means exclusively, through the influence
of "humanism,"&mdash;penetrated with a blind, almost superstitious,
love of learning for its own sake. They seem
always to have aspired to the "tall mountain citied to the
top, crowded with culture." This, indeed, applies not
only to the humanists, literary men, or translators of
classical works, but also to many of the practical and
matter-of-fact politicians of the time. Witness Peter of
Rosenberg, who died deploring "that he had not sufficiently
cultivated the study of literature;" or Harant
of Pol&#382;ic, whose constant show of classical erudition is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
striking, if sometimes tedious, and who, even when in
immediate peril of life, could not refrain from a classical
allusion.</p>

<p>The two earliest historians who belong to this period
both sprang from the class or "estate," as it was called,
of the citizens; they both held important municipal
offices at Prague, and they have both described short
but momentous episodes in Bohemian history, in which
they had played a conspicuous part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barto&#353; Pis&aacute;&#345;</span> (Bartholomew the writer), author of the
<i>Chronicles of Prague</i>,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> may be considered one of the most
valuable Bohemian historians. Bartholomew obtained
the by-name by which he is known because he had,
though a linen-draper by trade, frequently sought employment
of a literary character. We are, indeed, told
that he neglected his business for his literary pursuits,
and that whilst his wife was selling linen in the marketplace,
Bartholomew spent a large part of his time in
transcribing ancient manuscripts. He held a municipal
appointment at Prague for some time, and documents
are still existent which were copied out by Bartholomew.</p>

<p>It is certainly a proof of the extension of education
and of the intellectual activity of the time, that Barto&#353;,
a tradesman, should have undertaken, and successfully
undertaken, to write an important historical work.
Bartholomew's chronicle deals indeed with a very
limited subject, the troubles which, during the years
1524 to 1537, occurred in Prague; they were caused by
the rivalry of two ambitious upstarts, John Pas&#283;k and
John Hlavsa. During the weak reign of King Louis
these men both strove to obtain supreme authority in
the city of Prague, which thus became the scene of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>tumults and disturbances. Though dealing with an
apparently unimportant subject, Bartholomew's book is
of the greatest interest in giving a striking picture of the
town-life of Bohemia in the sixteenth century. Religious
controversy was the one engrossing interest among the
citizens, and the "Catilinarian individuals" (as a recent
Bohemian writer has called them), who contested for the
government of Prague, used religion as a pretext for
their ambitious endeavours. The rivals, indeed, both
belonged to the so-called Utraquist Church, which prided
itself in being directly based on the teaching of Hus.
This Church was the Established Church of Bohemia,
from the time of the Council of Basel and the signing of
the so-called "compacts" (1436), to the battle of the
White Mountain (1620).</p>

<p>Very characteristic of Bartholomew's manner are
his accounts of the disturbances of Prague, which
formed the original motive for his book. It is very
evident to a student of Bohemian history that in this
portion of Bartholomew's work light and shade are
very unequally divided; there was really very little to
choose between the two demagogues, Pas&#283;k and Hlavsa,
whose rivalry caused the disturbances at Prague. But
Bartholomew's style is here often quaint and picturesque;
and I think I could give no better specimen of
it than by translating his portraits of the rival Cleons
of Prague. Bartholomew writes: "Concerning those
two persons, John Hlavsa and Master John Pas&#283;k, they
both appeared as two brilliant lights, not only in Prague,
but also within the 'estate' of the townsmen generally;
for God had granted to both of them an enlightened
intellect, and eloquence greater than is usual among
men; yet they differed greatly with regard to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
character. Though in his manner Pas&#283;k appeared inclined
to kindliness, yet the immense and inexorable
malice of Cain ruled him, while on the, contrary Hlavsa
was guided by his peaceful and yielding nature.</p>

<p>"Pas&#283;k was born at Old Knin, of poor parents; his
mother had been a huckstress; as to his father, I have
been unable to ascertain anything certain. Therefore,
to avoid erring against truth, it is often fitter to give room
in my book only to the statements of men who are trustworthy
and sensible, rather than believe the assertions
of certain people. Pas&#283;k then was a poor school-servant,
and later on a schoolmaster. Afterwards he proceeded
to the University of Prague, where he became a
bachelor and master of arts. Then, ever rising in the
world, he was chosen by the citizens of the old town of
Prague as their chief town-clerk.... He was afterwards
chosen as alderman, and by his practice in the law
courts also gained large possessions, and his general
fortune in the world ever increased; for God is able to
raise a needy school-servant to high rank, as is said in
God's Scripture in the Psalms. And now, besides the
coat-of-arms which he had already received, a title, as a
further honour, was bestowed on him. He thus acquired
the right of calling himself John Pas&#283;k of Vrat,
obtaining thus a name that well befitted his individuality,
for it is true that he overturned and overthrew much.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
He then became excessively cruel, immoderately severe,
and tormented the people intolerably and unjustly....
Indeed, he once said openly to some people (for he was unable
to conceal his revengefulness, in which few were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>equal to him), 'Do not quarrel and dispute much in words
with your enemy, but wait till he is crossing a bridge;
then draw away his feet from under him so that he may
fall in.' This also he said boastingly: 'I am unable to
be so good a Christian as that I could forgive my enemies
what they have done against me.'"</p>

<p>Of Hlavsa Bartholomew writes: "John Hlavsa was
born in the town of St&#345;ibro (Mies), of honest and orderly
parents, who belonged to the estate of the townsmen.
He also, having previously been a needy scholar, afterwards
became a schoolmaster. Then, after he married,
he rose in the world, and during the reign of King
Vladislav obtained a coat-of-arms with the title of
'Liboslav.' Having an enlightened intellect and great
talents, he was elected an alderman, and soon obtained
the highest rank in that court. How much good he did
for the king and the estate of the townsmen, that is
known to many in Bohemia and elsewhere; but as
to the merits of the other (Pas&#283;k) there is silence.
Thence, in consequence of the king's taking away his
appointments from the one (Hlavsa) and giving them
to the other (Pas&#283;k), great hatred and jealousy sprung
up between them and spread widely; for it is the result
of vain worldly vanity that every one desires honours for
himself and not for others. And yet we must truthfully
admit (let who will be angry with me) that through these
discords much benefit and profit was obtained, rather
from the deeds of the one who had not obtained the
degree of master<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> (Hlavsa) than from those of the other,
as I have already stated. In consequence of the differences
between these two parties arose, one called that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>of Pas&#283;k and the other that of Hlavsa, and this extended
to many. Many also took part in these dissensions,
and were enraged against one another; the consequence
was a lamentable persecution of one party by
the other."</p>

<p>Bartholomew, like most Bohemian historians of his
time, lays no claim to impartiality, and he attacks the
Utraquists of the moderate faction almost more ferociously
than the partisans of Rome. Bartholomew was
certainly "a good hater," and his portrait of Archbishop
Rokycan is distinctly unfair. He indeed gives a totally
incorrect account of the negotiations of the Bohemian
Utraquists with the Eastern Church,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> for the purpose
of discrediting Rokycan by insinuating that he had
been treated with contempt by the dignitaries of the
Greek Church. Bartholomew, as already noticed, often
extends his narrative beyond its immediate subject, and
he has the taste for theological controversy which was
innate in almost all Bohemians at that time. The last
part of Bartholomew's book deals with the election of
Ferdinand I. as King of Bohemia in 1526; it has considerable
historical value, and has been largely used by
the writers who have reconstructed Bohemian history in
the present century. Bartholomew died in 1535, it is
not certain at what age.</p>

<p>The political career of the next historian with whom
I shall deal, <span class="smcap">Sixt of Ottersdorf</span> (born about the year
1500), was similar to that of Barto&#353; the Writer; but
Sixt appears to have taken a more prominent part in
the events which he related, and, differing herein from
Barto&#353;, he is by no means chary of references to his own
person. Like Bartholomew, Sixt belonged to the estate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>of the citizens. His talents and learning&mdash;we are told
that he studied for some time in foreign lands for the purpose
of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the Greek
language&mdash;raised him to a prominent position among
the citizens of Prague. As early as in 1537 we hear
of him as town-clerk of the old city of Prague, and he
was chancellor of the town in the momentous year
1546. His political career as well as his writings prove
him to have been a zealous partisan of the ancient
privileges of the Bohemian "Estates." Ferdinand I. of
Habsburg had in 1526 succeeded the weak sovereigns
of the Jagellonic dynasty as ruler of Bohemia. His
constant though often occult purpose was to strengthen
the royal prerogative and to limit the power of the
Bohemian Diet or Parliament. It seemed indeed at
one time probable that Ferdinand I. would accomplish
this task, which his grandson finally successfully
achieved after the battle of the White Mountain. In
this struggle between the king and the "Estates" Sixt
took an active part, and an episode of this struggle
(which lasted intermittently from 1526 to 1620) is the
subject of his memorable work, entitled the <i>History of</i>
<i>the Troubled Years in Bohemia, 1546 and 1547</i>.</p>

<p>To no literature is the sentence "Habent sua fata
libelli" more truly applicable than to that of Bohemia.
While the writings of Barto&#353; and Sixt, and indeed those
of the other historians also with whom I shall deal in
this chapter, remained almost unnoticed up to the
beginning of the present century, <span class="smcap">Hajek of Libo&#269;an's</span>
<i>Bohemian Chronicles</i> were widely known and circulated
from the moment that the book appeared. Hajek's work
was dedicated to Ferdinand I., and produced under
the auspices of that sovereign, who, indeed, appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
officials for the purpose of examining the contents of
the book before its appearance.</p>

<p>When, after the battle of the White Mountain, all
independent works of an historical character were suppressed
and many were completely destroyed, Hajek's
chronicle became, and continued for nearly two centuries,
the one source of information to which the few
writers on Bohemian history went. Many of the foolish,
displeasing, and untruthful tales referring to his country,
which a Bohemian so often finds in the writings of
foreign lands, can be traced to Hajek. It is in his work
that we find that account of Zi&#382;ka's death which has
been so often repeated, though it is as entirely contrary
to all we know of that great warrior as it is to the
reports of the contemporary chroniclers. Hajek tells
us that Zi&#382;ka, when dying, ordered that his body be
flayed and then thrown to the wild beasts, and that his
skin should be used as a drum.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> This and so many
other foolish tales have greatly contributed to the totally
false interpretation of ancient Bohemian history that is
current up to the present day.</p>

<p>The <i>Hussitenkrieg</i> of Theobaldus, and Lenfant in his
<i>Histoire des Guerres Hussites</i> (George Sand's authority
for her <i>Jean Z&#464;&#382;ka</i> and her <i>Comtesse de Rudolstadt</i>), both
borrow extensively from Hajek. As the works of Theobaldus
and Lenfant were recognised authorities on
Bohemian history up to the end of the eighteenth century,
Hajek's tales have been repeated by many writers
(for instance, Carlyle), who had probably never heard of
his name.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the present century it has
become possible to study freely the documents that refer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>to the ancient history of Bohemia. The result has been
that the glory of the "Bohemian Livy," as Hajek was
formerly called, has been completely obscured. It has
been proved that Hajek's work is totally untrustworthy,
and that he not only copied from earlier writers without
any attempt at criticism, but that he was often intentionally
mendacious, and for party purposes distorted his
account of historical events. The great Bohemian historian
Palack&yacute;'s judgment on Hajek has often been
quoted. Palack&yacute; wrote: "Hajek is the most narrow-minded
slyboots, the most na&iuml;ve humbug, and the apparently
most innocent calumniator whom I have met
in the course of my historical studies."</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to mention that at a period
when the rule "Scribitur ad narrandum, non ad probandum,"
was ignored by all Bohemian historians, Hajek's
work shows traces of party spirit almost on every page.
The author, who was a Romanist priest, writes as a strong
Catholic, and as a strong partisan of the Bohemian
aristocracy. Among the adherents of Rome, who were
then few in number in Bohemia, and who were Hajek's
principal protectors, were found several of the greatest
Bohemian nobles. These Catholic lords were always the
most decided enemies of the Bohemian cities, while the
Utraquist and Protestant nobles&mdash;though their caste
pride may have been as great&mdash;regarded the townsmen
as valuable allies in their struggle against the sovereign,
while the democratic character of the community of the
"Bohemian brethren" naturally also influenced the
nobles who belonged to it.</p>

<p>In his preface already Hajek enters into the question
of the rank and precedence among the Bohemian estates,
of course in a sense favourable to his patrons. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
writes: "Some have, for the purpose of disparaging the
estate of the nobles and that of the knights, dared to
maintain that the estate of the townsmen is the first,
and dates from the foundation of Prague. The estate
of the nobles, they say, sprung up afterwards, when
they (the nobles) acted as officials, and other men were
intrusted to their rule; then, they say, many years
later the estate of the knights was created, when the
king allowed them (the knights) to bear a device on
their shield because of certain deeds and brave exploits.
But both these statements are untrue." Hajek here
writes in contradiction to a Utraquist historian, Martin
Kuthen, who had stated that the origin of the Bohemian
estates was that mentioned above. Kuthen's work, which
has little value and requires no further notice, was then
very much read, and it has even been said that Hajek
was instructed to write his work as a refutation of that of
Kuthen.</p>

<p>Of Hajek's chronicle, which (as was customary in those
days) begins with the deluge, and which ends with the
coronation of his patron Ferdinand I., the earliest part
is by far the most attractive. Dealing with an almost
entirely mythical period, and one in which it was nearly
impossible to introduce political and ecclesiastical controversies
(though even here Hajek occasionally does
so), the author is at his best. He borrows largely from
Cosmas and from Dalimil, whose influence even on
Hajek's manner of writing can be traced in the early
part of his book. Hajek's style, indeed, always varies
greatly according to the authorities which he is using.
His account of the foundation of Prague is very curious.</p>

<p>But even in Hajek's accounts of semi-mythical occurrences
the insincerity and dishonesty that characterise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
him are often apparent. Cosmas and Dalimil related the
legends and traditions of their land just as they had
reached them from the earliest available oral or written
depositions. Hajek, on the contrary, always assumes
the part of a conscientious and systematic historian. He
indeed mentions Tacitus, Ptolemy, Strabo, Orosius, and
a limited number of medi&aelig;val writers among the authorities
whom, according to his statement, he had consulted.
Hajek's object was to join together various,
often contradictory, tales, and to give them the shape
of a chronologically consistent record of the lives of the
Premyslide princes. Was it for this purpose necessary
to alter traditional dates? That appeared to Hajek a
matter of no great importance!</p>

<p>Writing as a fervent partisan of Rome, Hajek of
course judges Hus and Jerome of Prague severely. Of
the latter he tells us: "In 1400 there arrived in
Prague, coming from England, a young man who had
gone there for the purposes of study, Jerome by name,
a citizen of the new town of Prague, the son of one
Albert (Vojt&#283;ch).... This Jerome had brought books
with him from England, into which he had copied out
some of the writings of 'John the Englishman,' whom
they call Wycliffe. This man had by his teaching
corrupted first a town in England called 'Oksa' or
'Oksonia,' and afterwards the whole English kingdom."
Of Hus, Hajek tells us that he was originally a good and
pious man, but that he came under the influence of two
Englishmen, "Jacob the Bachelor" and "Conrad of
Kandelburgk" (=Canterbury). These men used to visit
(according to Hajek!) the young masters of the university,
spreading Wycliffe's teaching and perverting
many from the true faith. At last "Master John of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Husinec, Master Jerome of Prague, Jacob of England,
and Conrad of 'Kandelburgk' were like one man."
This account of the origin of the Hussite movement&mdash;totally
incorrect, as so many of Hajek's statements&mdash;yet
proves that the writer was indeed the "narrow-minded slyboots"
Palack&yacute; has called him. By greatly exaggerating
the English influence on the foundation of Hussitism,
and stigmatising it as a foreign movement, Hajek, as he
well knew, greatly injured the Hussites; for the intense
national feeling that has always animated the Bohemians
has produced among them an often exaggerated
distrust of foreign interference.</p>

<p>With all its faults, Hajek's work will always find
readers. His style, though varying according to the
authorities which he is using, is generally animated, a
priceless merit in his pedantic age. An interest also is
connected with Hajek's chronicles which the author
could not have foreseen, and would not have desired.
Hajek's work, sanctioned by the Roman Church, and
therefore accessible to the people, continued to be read
when every other book on the early history of Bohemia
disappeared. It is thus to a large extent through Hajek's
chronicles that the Bohemians preserved some recollection
of their former greatness. A copy of Hajek's
chronicles went down from generation to generation
among the Bohemian peasantry, and was cherished as
an heirloom. As a lover would rather that evil be spoken
of his love than that her name remain unmentioned,
thus the Bohemians welcomed eagerly even hostile accounts
of the deeds of Zi&#382;ka, Prokop, and the other
leaders under whose guidance Bohemia had once defied
all Europe.</p>

<p>Of Hajek's life little is known, and that little is by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
means to his credit. The year of his birth is uncertain,
but we know that when very young he left the Utraquist
Church, in which he was born, became a Roman Catholic,
and took orders in that Church. We read of him as
preaching in the Church of St. Thomas at Prague in
1524, and by the aid of some Catholic nobles he obtained
in 1527 the deanery of Karlstein. Later he obtained
other ecclesiastical dignities. Of all these honours he
was subsequently deprived in consequence of an accusation
of having embezzled money belonging to the
Church. It has been suggested, though on insufficient
evidence, that Hajek wrote his chronicles for the purpose
of regaining the lost favour of his patrons. In 1544
Hajek, perhaps as a reward for his book that had appeared
in 1541, obtained the provostship of Star&aacute; Boleslav
(Alt Bunzlau), but of this dignity he was again
deprived in 1549 because of various offences against
canon law. Hajek died in 1553.</p>

<p>Several minor historians belong to this period. I have
already mentioned Martin Kuthen. The <i>History of the</i>
<i>Emperor Charles IV., King of Bohemia</i>, by Prokop Lup&aacute;&#269;;
(published in 1584), also deserves special notice. The
book is of interest to English readers, as the author has
inserted in it a considerable portion of a ballad describing
the death of King John at the battle of Cr&eacute;cy, which
was probably written shortly after that event.</p>

<p>The most prominent historians of this period were
probably the members of the community of the "Bohemian
Brethren." This is, however, unfortunately little
more than a conjecture. The works of the brethren
were specially singled out for destruction during the
Catholic reaction. Mere fragments remain, and even
with regard to these doubts as to their authorship often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
exist. The writings of Professor Goll, who has with
admirable skill and ability reconstructed the early history
of the brotherhood, also throw incidentally much light
on the literary activity of the brethren. The greatest
historian among them was probably Brother Blahoslav,
whose <i>Historie Bratrska</i> ("History of the Brotherhood")
was greatly admired; the book is known to us only by
quotations in some contemporary works which have
been preserved. As already mentioned, Blahoslav devoted
much time to the study of the grammar of the
Bohemian language, and he was celebrated for the
beauty of his style. It is, therefore, probable that in the
<i>History of the Brotherhood</i> we have lost not only a valuable
historical document, but also a masterpiece of Bohemian
prose-writing. With the exception of a short
Latin treatise on the history of the brotherhood, the
writings of Blahoslav that have been preserved are not
of a historical character; I have therefore referred to
him more fully in the last chapter.</p>

<p>In connection with Blahoslav I shall mention a work
that was formerly often attributed to him; this is the
<i>Captivity of John Augusta</i>. Recent research has proved
that this book was really written by the young clergyman
<span class="smcap">John Bilek</span>, Augusta's companion during his captivity.
It is, however, probable that the first part of the work
was revised by Blahoslav. The book deals with the
imprisonment of John Augusta, bishop of the Bohemian
Brethren, who was accused of having participated in the
negotiations with the German Protestant princes, into
which some Bohemians had entered in 1546 and 1547.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Bilek, Augusta's companion in captivity, has with
touching simplicity described his sufferings, the treachery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>of Sch&ouml;naich, town-captain of Leitomischl, the tortures
which Bilek and Augusta underwent, their long imprisonment
in the castle of P&uuml;rglitz (or K&#345;ivoklat), their
attempts to communicate from their prison with their
brethren who were at large, the relief of their sufferings
through the intercession of Philipina Welser, wife of the
Archduke Ferdinand, and their final liberation. The
book, written in a truly saintly spirit, never reveals the
slightest animosity against the officials who were treating
Augusta and his companion so cruelly. When narrating
the tortures that were inflicted on Augusta for the
purpose of forcing him to admit the complicity of the
Brotherhood in the supposed conspiracy, Bilek simply
writes: "The officials then ordered that he (Augusta)
should again be put on the rack, because of the questions
mentioned before; but it did not last long, as he had
become quite silent and swooned away. I think, had
they but continued a little longer, he would have died
during the torture."</p>

<p>Bilek's simple account of the daily routine and the
little incidents of prison life, often recalling Silvio Pellico,
is both interesting and touching. I will give one quotation
referring to the attempt of the prisoners to establish
communications with their friends outside the prison.
Bilek writes: "After they (the prisoners) had been in
prison some time, a year and a half and ten weeks, in
the year 1550, God our Lord wrought a great miracle;
He opened to them in their solitude and concealment a
secret and concealed path, by means of which their
friends could visit them, receive news of them, and also
convey news to them. And this happened thus. Among
the warders who guarded them, and who had received
rigid instructions how they were to guard them, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
a servant who knew them slightly, and knew also what
sort of men they were; for he had formerly been an
artisan at Leitomischl. He knew that they were enduring
all this suffering, not because of any crime, but for the
sake of the religion; and he felt a certain compassion
for them. This man risked all, and permitted that they
should receive from the brethren and from their friends
everything they required; and he also undertook to
forward secretly their friends' communications to them,
and their own to their friends. He began doing this
in 1550, before the Vigil of St. Paul's Confession, and
continued doing so up to the year 1553. He conveyed
to them the letters and communications of their brethren
and dear friends, and he supplied them with ink, paper,
and everything that is required for writing. A few
books also he brought them and other things which
they required, money and tapers; and they accepted
these things with no slight fear, principally with regard
to the servant; for he might have forfeited his life had
it been discovered that he had given us these things.
As regards themselves, they had commended their souls
to God and His grace, whatever might befall them; they
knew that they were acting rightly, and had therefore
little fear for their own persons; rather did they rejoice
that God had granted these things to them, and they
accepted them with gratitude and thanksgiving, and
praised their Lord God for this." The fact that so large
a part of the historical as well as of the theological
writings of the brethren has been destroyed enhances
the value of Bilek's book. The passages quoted above
give a true insight into the inner life of the Brotherhood;
they give evidence of their invincible courage and absolute
reliance on God, which gave them great strength,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
as well as of their exaggerated subserviency to even
unjust temporal authorities, which sometimes made them
poor politicians.</p>

<p>Of Bilek little is known but what he himself tells us
in his book. He was a clergyman of the Brotherhood,
and acted for a considerable time as secretary to Augusta,
the head of the community. He died at Napajedl in
Moravia in 1581, at the age of sixty-five. As already
mentioned, his book was formerly attributed to Blahoslav,
and only recent researches have awarded the authorship
to Bilek.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Very noteworthy among the historians of the Brotherhood
is <span class="smcap">Wenceslas B&#345;ezan</span>. To him Palack&yacute;'s remark,
that the Bohemians cared more for their history than
for the biographies of their historians, is particularly
applicable. Neither the year of the birth nor that of
the death of B&#345;ezan can be accurately ascertained; it has
been conjectured that he was born about the year 1560,
and died about the year 1619. Peter Vok, Lord of
Rosenberg, the greatest of the Bohemian nobles, and
a strenuous friend and protector of the Brotherhood,
appointed B&#345;ezan "archivarian, librarian, and historiographer
of the House of Rosenberg." Most of his works
deal with the annals of that great House, which for
centuries figured so prominently in Bohemian history.</p>

<p>The writings of B&#345;ezan, like those of so many other
Bohemian writers, have been only partially preserved.
Besides minor works referring to the annals and the
genealogy of noble Bohemian families, B&#345;ezan wrote a
large <i>History of the House of Rosenberg</i>, which is said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>have consisted of five volumes. Of this work only portions,
containing the biographies of William of Rosenberg
and of his brother, Lord Peter, the last of the Rosenbergs,
have reached us. From recent researches it,
however, appears probable that the German <i>Rosenbergische</i>
<i>Chronica</i> of Heerman, a monk of the monastery
of Wittingau (T&#345;ebo&#328;), is an abridged translation of the
lost parts of B&#345;ezan's book. In any case, the parts of
B&#345;ezan's work that have been preserved in Bohemian are
sufficient to prove that the work was far more than a
mere family record, and that it is of great value for the
social as well as for the political history of Bohemia.</p>

<p>The two biographies convey a vivid impression of the
court life (for it can hardly be otherwise described) of
the great Bohemian nobles during the period that preceded
the battle of the White Mountain. It is true that
the position of the Lords of Rosenberg, the first of the
Bohemian nobles, was a somewhat exceptional one.
This appears very clearly from the letters, published by
B&#345;ezan, which were interchanged between the members
of the imperial family and the Lords of Rosenberg. Of
the two biographies, that of William of Rosenberg, the
less interesting of the two brothers, is the more valuable
one. William held several important appointments
under the Imperial Government, and B&#345;ezan gives a
very clear outline of his official career. Very interesting
are B&#345;ezan's notes, which refer to the proposed election
of Lord William to the Polish throne. He tells us that
"the Lord of Rosenberg had then many adherents
among the Polish nobles, more indeed than the House
of Austria; and I do not say this to harm or disparage
that illustrious House." B&#345;ezan further tells us that
"the Poles, after they had thus been mocked (by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
flight of their king, Henry of Valois), searched for a new
king. Some favoured the House of Habsburg, others
desired Lord William as king, particularly as he was a
descendant of the ancient family of the Orsinis, as by
his ancestry, several centuries back, he was a Bohemian,
and therefore belonged to a cognate country; also because
he was a sensible, learned, temperate, Catholic
noble." The election of Stephen Bathory to the Polish
throne (1576) destroyed William of Rosenberg's hopes.</p>

<p>B&#345;ezan's biography of Lord Peter of Rosenberg is a
very disappointing book, if we consider that he was
dealing with an intensely interesting subject. The semi-independent
position of the great Bohemian nobles, who
lived principally on their vast estates, surrounded by
dependents and servants, free from the control of a
court, and to a great extent even from the criticism of
their equals, in some cases greatly developed their individuality.
To no one does this apply to a greater
extent than to Lord Peter of Rosenberg. The heir of
the great family that had supplied so many leaders to
the Romanist Church, Peter joined the community of
the Bohemian Brethren, it is said through the influence
of his wife, who belonged to that Church. Whether
there is any connection between this change of creed
and the scandalous stories which Catholic writers (whose
works alone were known in Bohemia during two centuries)
have circulated I do not wish to determine. They
tell us that Lord Peter established a "harem" at his
castle of Wittingau, to which the fairest women from all
parts of Europe were conveyed. This is obviously an
absurd exaggeration, though it is probable that Lord
Peter had in his youth led an immoral life. With regard
to the accusations of intemperance and of cruelty to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
servants, it is probable that Peter of Rosenberg was in
such matters neither better nor worse than the other
great Bohemian nobles of his time.</p>

<p>Where he indeed differed from many of them was in
his taste for literature and art. The Rosenbergs had at
all times taken much interest in the archives of their
family, and indeed preserved them so carefully that
most of these documents are even now in a state of
perfect preservation. Palack&yacute;, who examined them in
the present century, witnesses to this, as well as to their
great importance for the history of Bohemia, in which
the Lords of Rosenberg played so large a part. Peter
showed the same interest in the family archives as his
predecessors. When selling one of his castles to the
Emperor Rudolph II., he stipulated that he should retain
possession of one thousand documents which he considered
of historical value. In printed works also Lord
Peter's interest was great. As early as in 1573, twenty
years before he acceded to the family estates, Peter had
collected 243 printed volumes. B&#345;ezan, who had charge
of Lord Peter's library, and was authorised to enlarge it,
tells us that it was from this modest beginning that the
far-famed Rosenberg library sprang. Many books were
inherited from Lord William, and many purchased from
monasteries and elsewhere. The library at last became
a very extensive one. The Rosenberg library, in consequence
of the events of the Thirty Years' War, eventually
found its way to Stockholm, where B&#345;ezan's catalogue of
the library is also still preserved. Peter of Rosenberg is
notable also as a patron of literature, and, among others,
the poet Lomnick&yacute;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> enjoyed his protection for many
years. Lomnick&yacute; showed his gratitude by writing on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>the death of Peter of Rosenberg perhaps his one touching
and heartfelt poem. That Peter was, like his brother,
interested in alchemy, hardly requires mention, for almost
all the great Bohemian nobles then followed the example
of Rudolph, their sovereign, who delighted in the study
of alchemy.</p>

<p>Peter's interest in music was also very great. Even
before inheriting Wittingau from his brother William, he
had established a small orchestra at B&#283;ychin, and he
afterwards devoted much time and expense to the improvement
and aggrandisement of the magnificent
orchestra which Lord William had founded at Wittingau.
B&#345;ezan, in his biographies of both brothers, gives an
interesting account of the cultivation of music in Bohemia
in the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth
century. Lord Peter also undoubtedly showed a considerable
amount of interest in other arts. In B&#345;ezan's
biography, written in chronological order, we read under
"December 19, 1598.&mdash;The Lord of Hradec sent our
sovereign lord (Lord Peter) eighteen pretty painted
figures, very poetical, and representing Venus."</p>

<p>In Bohemian politics Peter of Rosenberg played a
very important part, and his change of creed appeared
as an event of the greatest importance on the ever-varying
stage of Bohemian political life. Peter of Rosenberg
was on terms of intimacy with Christian of Anhalt, perhaps
the greatest statesman of the seventeenth century.
He acted as Anhalt's representative in Bohemia, and was
no doubt initiated into his far-reaching plans. Anhalt,
as recent research has sufficiently proved, intended to
use the dissensions between Rudolph and his brother
Matthew for the purpose of totally destroying the power of
the House of Habsburg. On these and similar subjects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the greatest interest B&#345;ezan has little or no information to
give, and his biography, as already stated, is disappointing.</p>

<p>The book, written in chronological order, contains
accounts of Lord Peter's travels, but here, too, a mere
outline of the occurrences is given. When mentioning
Peter's journey to England, B&#345;ezan merely tells us (under
February 1563) that "after Lord Peter had been received
in England with Christian kindness by her royal majesty
Queen Elizabeth, and had then been kindly and graciously
dismissed, her majesty was graciously pleased to grant
him a royal decree addressed to all her officials and to
those of all the towns." B&#345;ezan then gives the full
wording of this passport, if we may thus call it, in which
Lord Peter is described as "one of the chamberlains of
our good brother the King of the Romans."</p>

<p>B&#345;ezan devotes much space to detailed accounts of the
domestic arrangements at the castle of Wittingau, and
his book is a treasury for those who would study the
social condition of Bohemia at this period. B&#345;ezan's
style has little grace, partly no doubt in consequence of
the chronological form which he has given to his book.
The following portrait of Lord Peter of Rosenberg is a
characteristic specimen of B&#345;ezan's style: "Lord Peter's
motto was 'In silentio et in spe.' It should be mentioned
that this lord, for the purpose of living wisely, prudently,
and in a way that beseems a Christian, and also that he
might constantly remember death, always had a death's
head placed on a board over the table in his apartment.
He even founded an association, the device of which was
a golden death's-head of the value of eight ducats. This
badge he himself usually wore round his neck. It had
on one side the inscription, 'Memento mori,' and on the
other, 'Cogita &aelig;ternitatem.' And this order he distri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>buted
among his friends, both lords and ladies, and he
ordered me to keep a special register, where the names
of these persons were entered."</p>

<p>"He was a nobleman of well-shaped figure, and more
refined than his brother William. His features were
charming, his manners dignified and truly princely, his
speech was sensible, he was compassionate and affable,
and though he was sometimes angry, whenever he had
scolded or cursed some one he always afterwards excused
himself with mild words. He was a gay and
jocose nobleman, though in his old age he gave himself
up entirely to piety, read religious books with pleasure,
and listened eagerly to the word of God. He was keen
for all novelties, a lover of all sciences and arts, and he
spent large sums on them. He had a special fancy
and predilection for building, and in this resembled his
brother William. He was in the habit of standing
oftener than sitting, and of walking constantly, and so
quickly that it was difficult even for young men to keep
up with him. By a bequest in his will he provided for
the maids of the woman-apartments, and freed them
(from bondage), ordering that each should receive a sum
of gold as a present; and as trustees for this bequest he
appointed Albert Pauzar of Michnic and Volesn&aacute;, Henry
Caslav of Podol, and Frederick Frok&#353;tejn of Naceslavic,
his servants and courtiers."</p>

<p>"He was a very valorous nobleman, courageous and
even somewhat venturesome; for he boldly approached
wild beasts, bears, wolves, horses, and dogs without feeling
any fear. And, on the whole, I do not know that
anything was wanting in this heroic personage, except
that which he himself deplored on his death-bed, that
he had not sufficiently cultivated the study of literature."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter of Rosenberg died in 1611, only a few years before
the momentous events which so completely changed the
destinies of his country.</p>

<p>It is a natural and easy transition from Peter of Rosenberg
to another great Bohemian nobleman, Charles of
&#381;erotin, who indeed was often politically associated with
Rosenberg, particularly during the contest between King
Rudolph II. and his brother Matthew, which occurred
in the early years of the seventeenth century. &#381;erotin
was, it is true, a maker rather than a writer of history.
On two occasions, in 1608 when Rudolph was contending
with his treacherous younger brother Matthew, and
in 1619, when Frederick of the Palatinate attempted to
oust the house of Habsburg from the Bohemian throne,
&#381;erotin's attitude to a great extent decided the fate of his
country. &#381;erotin's numerous writings may also be considered
materials for history rather than historical works.
Yet no outline of Bohemian literature would be complete
were the name of &#381;erotin omitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles of &#381;erotin</span> was born in 1564 at Brandeis, on
the Adler, one of the Bohemian estates of his powerful
family. Like many Bohemian noblemen of this period,
Charles spent a considerable part of his youth in foreign
countries, both as a student and as a soldier. At Genoa
he fell under the influence of the Calvinist divine Theodore
de Beza, but he never (as has been stated) abandoned
for Calvinism the Church of the Bohemian
Brethren, to which his family had belonged from the
time that the Brotherhood had been founded. His
writings as well as his political career prove that he
was a faithful adherent of that community, of which
he was one of the most illustrious members.</p>

<p>In the year 1591 he took service under Henry IV. of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
France, whom all Protestants then recognised as their
leader. &#381;erotin's correspondence, which is very extensive,
is particularly interesting when he refers to this
period of his life.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> He appears to have felt very little
sympathy for the French prince, to have distrusted
him, and almost to have foreseen his conversion to the
Church of Rome. &#381;erotin, whose motives were always
disinterested and elevated though often unpractical, could
not have felt much sympathy for an "opportunist."</p>

<p>&#381;erotin's later life was spent almost entirely in Bohemia
and Moravia, the countries where his ancestral estates
were situated. He favoured the cause of the Archduke
Matthew against King Rudolph in 1609, and in 1618
was one of the few Protestant noblemen who remained
faithful to the House of Habsburg. As reward for his
fidelity, he was allowed to remain in his country after
the battle of the White Mountain, when most Protestants
had already been expelled. He was even able
to afford aid and shelter to many other members of
the Brotherhood. Among these was Komensk&yacute;. He
sought refuge at Brandeis, and wrote there his <i>Labyrinth</i>
<i>of the World</i>, which was dedicated to &#381;erotin.</p>

<p>The increasing persecution of all who did not belong
to the Church of Rome finally induced &#381;erotin to leave
Bohemia and Moravia and to retire to Breslau. It was
here that he spent the last years of his life, and he left
his extensive library to that city. &#381;erotin was, however,
still permitted to visit occasionally his extensive
estates. During one of these visits he died at Prerov
in Moravia in 1636. His body was interred at Brandeis
on the Adler, his ancestral home.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>
<p>&#381;erotin has left voluminous writings. His correspondence,
to which I have already alluded, was very
extensive. Continued, as it was, during the whole of
his life, it is, of course, of the greatest value for the
history of his time, &#381;erotin has also left several volumes
of memoirs, referring principally to the doings of the
Diet of Moravia during the period that he presided
over that assembly. He also wrote a very curious work
entitled <i>Obrana</i> or <i>Apology</i>, addressed to George, Lord
of Hodic. It appears that Hodic had blamed &#381;erotin
publicly for having temporarily retired from political
life. This work, written in a pure but eloquent manner,
showing traces of profound study of the classical writers,
is a recognised masterpiece of Bohemian prose. The
original great reluctance of the members of the Brotherhood
to enter the stormy arena of political life had
indeed decreased since many nobles and other influential
persons had joined their Church, but traces of this
feeling appear in &#381;erotin's work. He writes: "You
were pleased, my Lord of Hodic, to remark of me at
the meeting of the Estates that 'I act wrongly in stifling
the gifts which God has given to me.' By these words&mdash;few
and quickly spoken, yet containing much meaning&mdash;you
were pleased to attack me sharply and to deal
me a severe blow; for what else is stifling God's gift
but refusing to remain in that state in which God has
placed us? And what, again, is not remaining in the
state in which God has placed us but not being as I
should be? What conclusion then can be drawn other
than that if I am not as I should be, then&mdash;though I
declare that I am a lover of my country, her true son,
an own limb of her body, sharing her wounds&mdash;in fact,
her twin-brother, who was born with her and will die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
with her&mdash;my pride is idle and my word worthless if
my acts are not in accordance with my sentiments.
Idle indeed would it be if I could bring nothing forward
and give no proof that I am what I say that I
am. Then indeed your argument would be powerful
and your words conform to truth and justice, and I
myself should then agree with them. For it is my firm
conviction that no man is good but he who by his deeds
proves that he is good.</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;deign to excuse me&mdash;have given no cause for
your judgment on me. That my manner is somewhat
different from what it was some time ago, and that I do
not labour so assiduously for the welfare of my country
as I did some time back, that is no proof that I have lost
and abandoned all my innate love and affection for it.
As the sun does not cease to be the sun when for a
moment it sets in the midst of clouds, and as a fire
does not lose its heat if it does not immediately pierce
through cold tiles, and as a field also must not be considered
barren when for a time it lies fallow, and so to
speak rests; so I also ought not and should not be declared
wanting in the love and care for my country which
it is my duty to have, because I do not try my skill on
every course (=take part in every political contest).</p>

<p>"For as prudent sailors are carried, when the sea is
calm, here and there and catch the wind in their sails,
and then, when a storm arises, and for a time drives
them from their straight course, they yet remain out at
sea and guard themselves as best they can with the compass
till a more favourable wind guides them to their
destined port; thus I also avoid the present evil times
and their difficulties, and conceal myself from the storm
as under a roof till more convenient times arise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>&#381;erotin has here in beautiful words expressed thoughts
that almost condemn him as a statesman. It is true that
shortly after the publication of the <i>Obrana</i> he appeared
more prominently on the political scene than at any other
time during the struggle between King Rudolph and his
brother Matthew; but during the far more momentous
struggle of the last years of Bohemian independence
(1618-1620) &#381;erotin as far as was possible chose the part
of the prudent mariner, but the port which he finally
reached was exile!</p>

<p>Before mentioning the latest historians of this period,
I must notice a considerable number of accounts of
travels, books which are closely connected with history.
The Bohemians were great travellers in those days, and
a considerable number of them have recorded their
journeys and adventures. I have already referred to
John of Lobkovic when dealing with his more celebrated
brother Bohnslav,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and the travels of &#381;erotin and
Rosenberg have also been already mentioned. Of other
records of travel, it will be sufficient to mention those of
Prefat, Vratislav, and Harant of Pol&#382;ic. Ulrick Prefat
of Vlkanov, a citizen of Prague, undertook in 1546 a
journey to Venice and Palestine, of which he has left us
an interesting account. His descriptions of the Holy
Land are, however, inferior to those of Harant, written
somewhat later. <span class="smcap">Venceslas Vratislav</span> of Mitrovic, born
(1576) of a Roman Catholic family, was educated by the
Jesuits, and had from his earliest youth a strong desire
to visit distant lands. When not yet eighteen years of
age he obtained permission to join the staff of Baron
Krekvic, whom the Emperor Rudolph was sending as
ambassador to Constantinople. He has left us a record
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>of his journey and imprisonment;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> for the Turks of that
period had little regard for international law and diplomatic
privileges. Vratislav's book has a certain youthful
grace and simplicity, and he was by no means devoid of
the gift of observation.</p>

<p>Vratislav, on his return to Bohemia, published in 1599
the description of his travels and adventures. He afterwards,
not unnaturally, took part in several campaigns
against his old enemies, the Turks. Educated by the
Jesuits and a staunch Romanist, he was, of course, on
the side of the Archduke Ferdinand during the Bohemian
troubles of 1618 to 1620.</p>

<p>Far more interesting as an author, and far more representative
of his time than the two last-named writers, is
<span class="smcap">Christopher Harant</span>, Lord of Pol&#382;ic and Bezdruzic. It
is therefore perhaps not amiss to study his work and his
life somewhat more in detail. Harant was born in 1564,
of an ancient knightly family of Bohemia. He received
the thorough education and literary training which was
then customary with many of the Bohemian noble families.
Harant, we are told, possessed a thorough knowledge
of Greek, Latin, German, Italian, Spanish, as well
as, of course, his own language. It has even been
said that it was out of patriotism that he published his
celebrated book of travels in Bohemian instead of in
German, though that would, of course, have secured for
the book far more numerous readers. Harant's classical
erudition was considered extensive even at that period,
when in Bohemia the almost superstitious veneration
for the great writers of Rome and Greece was at its
height. Harant's own list of his authorities includes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>almost all known writers, both Greek and Latin, from
Homer and Herodotus to Statius and Claudianus.
Later Latin writers, such as Gregory of Tours and
Orosius, are also quoted by Harant; his vast erudition
included even Byzantine writers such as Suidas, Zonaras,
and Chalkokondylas. More recent works, such as the
writings of Guicciardini, were also well known to Harant;
he quotes even from such (now) little known works as
the French histories of Du Tillet and Bernard de Girard,
and the <i>Res Burgundic&aelig;</i> and <i>Res Austriac&aelig;</i> of Pontus
Heuterus. Harant's education was completed at the
court of the Archduke Ferdinand at Innsbruck. When
referring to his passage through Innsbruck on his way
to Venice, Harant gives an interesting account of his
stay at the archducal court. The years 1591 to 1597
were spent by Harant in the service of the Emperor
Rudolph, who, in his capacity of King of Bohemia, had
demanded aid from that country in his wars against the
Turks. Harant appears greatly to have distinguished
himself in these campaigns, and we are told that
Rudolph, in consideration of his services, granted him
an annuity chargeable on the Bohemian revenue.
Harant's campaigns in Hungary (a large part of which
country was then under Turkish rule) may have suggested
to him the idea of visiting countries yet farther
east. He tells us in his preface to his book of travels
that he wished "to see those countries which were the
scene of the holiest, wisest, and most celebrated events
mentioned in the Old and in the New Testament ...
those lands which were once an earthly paradise. These
lands," he continues, "I purposed to visit with special
ardour and with great danger for my life, and I set out
with God's help." A family bereavement&mdash;Harant's first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
wife died in 1597&mdash;probably confirmed him in his decision,
and he started from Pilsen in April 1598 on his
long and perilous journey, accompanied by his friend
Herman C&#283;rnin, Lord of Chudenic, and only one servant.</p>

<p>Harant's account of this journey, published as <i>Christopher</i>
<i>Harant's Journey to Venice, and thence to the Holy</i>
<i>Land and to Egypt</i>,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> has assured to the author a not inconsiderable
place in the annals of Bohemian literature.
Harant undoubtedly possessed the gift of observation to
an unusual extent, and his descriptions of the scenery
he viewed and the men he met are often very vivid.
Though the book is generally written in a grave and
somewhat pedantic manner, yet some passages show
that Harant was by no means devoid of humour. The
work has, however, the fault of being somewhat long-winded,
and Harant is too fond of lengthy historical
digressions, introduced for the purpose of exhibiting
his learning. This is particularly true of the part of the
book which deals with Harant's visit to Egypt. He
here introduces a lengthy treatise on the early dynasties
of Egyptian rulers, which is, of course, valueless from
the point of view of modern research. Harant was
very fond, almost too fond, of quoting; yet his quotations,
chosen from many writers in various languages,
are often quaint and amusing, and remind the reader
of Montaigne. On the whole, Harant's work is one of
those ancient Bohemian books that can still be read
with amusement as well as interest.</p>

<p>From Pilsen, Harant and his companions travelled
through Tyrol to Venice, where they stayed some time.
The indefatigable Harant studied not only the monuments,
but also the constitution of Venice, which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>greatly admired. The Venetian constitution in many
ways resembled that which Harant and his party wished
to establish in Bohemia, and he gives a full account of it,
"as an example for us and for our benefit," as he writes.
Harant and his friend were obliged to remain some time
in Venice before they found other pilgrims to the Holy
Land, with whom they jointly chartered a ship to Jaffa.
Among these new companions was "Lambert the Dutchman,"
who appears to have been a constant cause alternately
of indignation and of amusement to the other
travellers. On leaving Venice the pilgrims sailed along
the coast of Dalmatia, and by way of the Ionian Islands,
Candia, and Cyprus, finally reached the harbour of Jaffa.
From here they proceeded to Jerusalem. Harant thus
describes their arrival there:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When we had arrived within four Bohemian miles
of Jerusalem, we noticed everywhere the industry of the
Jews and former inhabitants of the land; for they had
laid out all those hills in vineyards, gardens, and fields,
though they are now deserted and overgrown with
thorns, yet the traces of the former divisions of the fields
by means of low wells and small steps still remain; we
can thus know how full of cities this land was; and on
this short journey we remarked the astonishing laziness
of the present inhabitants, of whom the country now
feeds about ten to a thousand formerly. Yet the northern
side of the hill has remained tolerably fertile in vineyards,
olives, figs, pomegranates, and other fruits.</p>

<p>"When we were about two miles from Jerusalem the
dragoman<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> from that town came out on purpose to meet
us; for our dragoman from Rama had hurried on,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>leaving us behind, and had informed the guardian of the
monastery (of St. Salvador) and the other dragoman of
our arrival.</p>

<p>"With the guardian the <i>vicarius</i> of the monastery also
appeared, and when they came near us they greeted us
in Italian and asked us many questions; for instance,
from where we came, how we had fared on our journey,
and what had happened during our travels in our own
country and the lands through which we had passed.
And thus continuing our conversation we arrived at the
gates of the city of Jerusalem about vesper-time. Our
whole journey from Venice to Jerusalem had lasted forty-four
days; we had then travelled 458 Bohemian miles
from Venice and 582 from Bohemia, both by land and
by sea."</p>

<p>Harant and his companions spent a fortnight at
Jerusalem as guests of the monks of the Monastery of
St. Salvador, and he gives a detailed account of their
visits to the historical spots in the city and neighbourhood.
Harant's description of his visit to the Chapel of
the Holy Sepulchre is interesting. He writes: "When
we approached these Turks (there were eight altogether,
some of whom sat on stone benches covered with carpets,
which since ancient times have been placed beside
the gates of the church), one of them came forward
with the keys and opened the locked gates of the
church; then they immediately let us into the church
one by one, counting us till they had got us all in line,
then they hastily closed the gates and sealed them;
there are two gates, one next to the other, made of
fine marble, on which costly figures are carved. That
gate which opens on the right into the church is walled
up, but the other one opens by halves, and in the lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
half there is a gap or window through which one can
see into the court, and from the court into the church.
And having entered the church, we next arrived before
the chapel or cell in which is the grave of our Lord,
and then we all immediately knelt down piously. But
Master Antonio Donato (one of Harant's fellow-travellers)
fell to the ground heavily as soon as he entered
the chapel, just as if he had fainted, and we, seeing
this, were greatly frightened, for we knew of no other
cause of his fall except his great religious ardour; but
he soon recovered, and, after he had recited some
prayers, he rose together with us. The guardian then
put on his vestments ... and first led us to a cupboard
in the wall, similar to a blind window. There we saw
a portion of a pillar of stone similar to marble; to this
column the holy body of Christ was bound while he
allowed himself to be scourged and cruelly flogged in
the house of Pilate. This portion of the column is
three spans in length, and the breadth is somewhat
greater; it stands behind a very thick iron trellis
fastened to the wall. There is a small window opposite,
which opens with a lock, and before the pillar there
always hangs a lamp, which continually glistens and
burns. At this spot we began to sing the hymn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>Eia Fratres Charissimi Christe</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Christi mortis mysteria</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Canamus</i>,' &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of all other memorable sites in Jerusalem itself, as
well as of those at Bethlehem, Jericho, and elsewhere,
Harant gives equally detailed and accurate accounts;
his book is indeed still of value for the topography of
Palestine. Harant also gives a very curious description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
of the city of Jerusalem as he himself saw it. He
writes: "In the town of Jerusalem there are some
streets that are vaulted over, and in some of these shopkeepers,
Christians, Jews, and Turks, in others tradesmen
such as shoemakers and weavers, and yet in others
cooks have vaulted stalls, just like the booths in the old
town of Prague.... The houses in the town are mostly
tolerably solid; the greater part are without roof, and
have only terraces; others have vaulted roofs. A third
part of the houses in the town are deserted and in ruins.
There are many open spaces, and they occupy a third
part of the city. Of wood there is very little in the
buildings, indeed there is less in the whole town than
in some houses at Prague; the town is therefore very
safe from fires. Its size is about that of Kuttenberg
(Kutna Hora) here in the Bohemian land."</p>

<p>Harant's account of the different Christian communities,
the members of which then visited Palestine, and
who had religious foundations there, are still of the
greatest interest. He enumerates, "besides the Latin,
that is to say, Roman Catholic Christians, many other
sects, Christians belonging to various nationalities, such
as Greeks, Armenians, Georgians, Syrians, Nestorians,
Jacobites, Abyssinians, Maronites, and others." In the
Greeks, Harant, as a lover of classical antiquity, naturally
took far greater interest than in the adherents of the
other churches which he enumerates. Harant's chapter
on the Greeks is written with interesting and very evident
enthusiasm. "The Greek nation," he tells us, "was in
former days far superior to all others in matters of
government and politics. Among them first arose lawgivers,
from whom others, took and acquired the true
rules of government. Among them (the Greeks) were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
wise men, 'sapientes Gr&aelig;ci&aelig;,' famous all over the world,
and the most learned of men in all sciences; they first
of all discovered botany and medical science; they
divided time by months and years. Arithmetic, geometry,
physics, ethics, and other kinds of philosophy they
improved and advanced; they then faithfully and carefully
preserved all these things, so that they were
called the mother and origin of all literary and other
free arts; and thus they were superior to all other
nations.</p>

<p>"Besides this, for many centuries they knew neither
kingly nor monarchical rule; they governed themselves
according to their own constitutions, some in a democratic,
others in an aristocratic manner (what the latter
was I have explained in my description of Venice);
therefore all the neighbouring kings in every direction
were their mortal enemies, whom they had to encounter
in many great wars."</p>

<p>From Palestine the travellers proceeded to Egypt,
embarking at Gaza for Damietta, then the principal
seaport of Egypt. The sea-voyage was tedious and
unpleasant. Harant (from whose mind Bohemia was
hardly ever absent) described the passengers who embarked
with him and his companions as a "Senftenberg
rabble."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>After a short stay in Egypt, Harant and his companions
returned to Venice, and thence to their own country.
In 1608 he published, on the request of his friends,
the graphic description of his travels, which fortunately
has been preserved. Harant appears to have enjoyed
great favour with King Rudolph, who raised him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>to the rank of a noble. Harant had hitherto belonged
to the "estate" of the knights. Somewhat later, Harant,
who had been brought up as a Romanist, joined the
Utraquist or Calixtine Church, probably mainly from
political motives. Harant was a zealous partisan of the
ancient Bohemian constitution and of the national language.
The Jesuits, then the most prominent leaders of
the Roman party in Bohemia, well knew that it would
only be possible to destroy the old Church of Hus and
to re-establish Romanism if the ancient constitution
were suppressed, and the Bohemian language and literature
also, as far as possible, destroyed.</p>

<p>In the stirring events of the last years of Bohemian
independence (1618-1620) Harant played a very prominent
part. He commanded the artillery of the Bohemian
army which, under Count Thurn, invaded Austria
and besieged Vienna in 1619; it is stated that he ordered
his gunners to point their cannon against the windows
of the palace (Burg) in Vienna in which the Emperor
Ferdinand had taken refuge. This probably caused
Harant to be singled out as one of those Bohemian
nobles to whom the severest punishment was awarded,
and in fact sealed his fate. During the short reign of
King Frederick, Harant held high office, and when the
battle of the White Mountain ended that prince's short
reign, he sought refuge in his castle of Pecka. He was
there taken prisoner by the Austrian troops in March
1621. It is characteristic of the man that on the day
when the troops arrived he should, when, on his leaving
his castle for an early walk, a gust of wind blew off his

turn back and not stir a step from the house to-day."
Harant was one of the Bohemian leaders who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
were decapitated on June 21, 1621. I have quoted<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
Sk&aacute;la ze Zho&#345;e's account of his last moments.</p>

<p>Of the latest historians of this period, <span class="smcap">Paul Sk&aacute;la ze</span>
<span class="smcap">Zho&#345;e</span> is certainly the most important. Palack&yacute; has
called him "not only the most voluminous, but also the
most valuable historian of Bohemia;" he might perhaps
have been considered the foremost historian of his
country before the present century, since which time
that rank belongs uncontestedly to Palack&yacute; himself. I
cannot formulate my opinion of Sk&aacute;la more accurately
than I did some years ago, when I wrote: "Sk&aacute;la's description
of the turbulent scenes on the Hrad&#269;in on the
day of the defenestration, and the truly pathetic account
of the last hours and execution of the Bohemian
leaders in 1621, are masterpieces of historical writing. I
may confidently say that they would do credit to the
literature of a larger and better known country than
Bohemia."</p>

<p>Paul Sk&aacute;la ze Zho&#345;e, born in 1583, belonged, like
Barto&#353; and Sixt, to the "estate" of the citizens or townsmen.
He was educated at the then very celebrated Protestant
university of Wittenberg, and his life and writings
both prove that he was a staunch adherent of the Protestant
faith. He was for some time employed in the
municipal offices of the town of Saaz (or &#381;&aacute;tec), and he
held a Government appointment at Prague during the
Provisional Government of 1618 and the short reign of
Frederick of the Palatinate. He was an eye-witness of
some of the events of that memorable period. He left
Bohemia after the battle of the White Mountain and
the flight of King Frederick, at whose court he remained
during the first years of his exile. He afterwards settled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>at Freiberg in Saxony, not very far from the frontier of
Bohemia, to which country many of the exiles still hoped
once more to return.</p>

<p>It was here that Sk&aacute;la undertook his great historical
works. He first wrote a <i>Chronology of the Church</i>. This
book is a mere compilation of dates, including some
that are of a very fantastic character. Sk&aacute;la counts 1656
years from the creation of the world to the deluge,
and 1717 thence to the foundation of the first Chald&aelig;an
monarchy. This book seems only to have been
intended to be a preparation for his great historical
work, the <i>Historie Cirkevni</i> ("History of the Church"), a
book which, in spite of its title, deals as much with
political as with ecclesiastical matters. This colossal
work is preserved in MS. in ten enormous volumes (the
largest contains 1700 pages, the others but little fewer)
in the library of Count Waldstein at Dux. The part of
the book that refers to the Bohemian events of the
years 1602 to 1623 has been edited and published by
Dr. Tieftrunk in two large volumes. It is, of course,
the most interesting part of the enormous work, as
Sk&aacute;la here writes as a contemporary, and sometimes as
an eye-witness.</p>

<p>Sk&aacute;la of course writes as a staunch Protestant and
an enemy of the absolutist party. No Bohemian historian
of this period, as I have already remarked, was
without a strong political and theological bias; yet
Sk&aacute;la tells us at the beginning of his account of the
Bohemian movement of 1618: "I have not the intention,
either here or in any part of my narrative, of
writing anything whatever under the inspiration of partiality
or of good-will or ill-will towards this party or
that. Neither will I personally endorse the praise or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
blame which others have expressed. I only state those
various facts which I have found in other authors'
writings (printed or in manuscript) which are conform
to truth. Judgment I leave to prudent, truth-loving
men, who have a more profound knowledge of these
events than I, in my exile, have been able to obtain."
These statements, written to prove Sk&aacute;la's impartiality,
are not entirely correct, or at least apply only to the
years after 1620, when Sk&aacute;la, an exile from Bohemia,
had to rely on the authority of others. Of previous
events he frequently writes as an eye-witness. Thus,
when referring to the removal of the altars and paintings
from the cathedral-church of St. Vitus at Prague
in 1619, Sk&aacute;la writes: "Though I and other officials
were working in the neighbouring state offices between
one and two o'clock, we heard nothing of what was
happening in the royal church (St. Vitus); only next
morning, when I entered the church, I saw that the
pictures had been removed."</p>

<p>Sk&aacute;la gives a very able account of the ancient Bohemian
constitution, of which he writes as a fervent admirer.
He then states what in his opinion was the
cause of the destruction of that constitution. "The
Bohemian nation," he writes, "has indeed this peculiarity,
that it can endure neither complete tyranny nor
complete liberty unfettered by law. And as the Bohemians
defended their ancient liberties with such true
zeal, they might have been happier than other nations
had they but at home maintained sincere concord among
themselves. I doubt that any one would have been able
to overcome them by force of arms if they had been
bound together by the bond of patriotic mutual confidence;
but in consequence of religious differences, great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
discord reigned among them, and therefore mutual distrust.
One section, which conformed to the Church of
Rome, assumed the name of Catholics or communicants
in one kind. The other section, which loved to worship
and serve God according to the definitions and rules of
the Holy Scripture, and not according to the fancies of
men, are called communicants under both kinds (Utraquists),
or Evangelicals or Hussites, from the name of
their teacher, that true martyr for Christ, John Hus, or
'of Husinec,' who in his time re-established pure doctrine
in the Bohemian land, and from the darkness of
Papacy raised it to light.... Many years ago regulations,
which the Bohemians obtained by the bravery
with which they defended God's truth, stipulated that
nobody who did not receive the flesh and blood of our
Lord Christ in both kinds should occupy the offices of
the state and of the towns.... Thus almost all men
acknowledged the salutary doctrine that man is redeemed
by his faith in Christ and through His holy merit, and
that he thus obtains eternal salvation."</p>

<p>But afterwards Sk&aacute;la says: "The Jesuits endeavoured,
with all their might, to disseminate among imprudent
young men, whose confidence they obtained by flattery,
not only the teaching of the Roman school, but also
hatred against the National Church and contempt for
the glorious rights, regulations, and constitutions of the
land; and thus they strove to form them according to
their own will; but yet more they approached with
flattery the highest officials and judges of the land also,
as well as some of the greatest lords; and then, when
they had inspired them with their own Jesuitical spirit,
then, as if they had been soulless bodies, possessing
neither reason nor common-sense, they ruled them ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>cording
to their own will ... and they thus obtained
that all real strength and ruling power was concentrated
in them (<i>i.e.</i> the Jesuits), though the name and
appearance of power and political importance was
retained by the officials. Then only the Roman religion,
which had almost died out in Bohemia, seemed suddenly
to bloom again and to recover its power. On the
other hand, the respect for the royal majesty constantly
decreased; the kingdom, hitherto peaceful, became turbulent
and seditious; the estates not only differed
among themselves, but were also irritated against the
king their lord, when under cover, and in the name of
the royal majesty, evil and turbulent men artfully carried
out their knavish plans and endeavours; in fact, every
sort of licentiousness appeared openly and without restraint
among the people."</p>

<p>But of greater interest than any other part of Sk&aacute;la's
book are the pages that deal with the closing days of
Bohemian independence. In writing of the tragedy
that opened with the defenestration in 1618, and ended
with the executions at Prague in June 1621, Sk&aacute;la is
always graphic and often pathetic.</p>

<p>I shall quote a short portion of Sk&aacute;la's account of the
events that mark the beginning and the close of the
Bohemian movement.</p>

<p>In his account of the defenestration Sk&aacute;la writes: "... Then
Joaquin, Count Schlick, ardently and with
tears in his eyes, for he was a true and zealous follower
of the religion, addressed the assembly and violently
attacked Martinic and Slavata.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> He reminded them of
the wrongs which they had inflicted both on Utraquists
individually and on the whole Evangelical Church, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>of how they had dealt with them according to the
suggestions of those malicious teachers of theirs, the
members of the sect of the Jesuits. He said that they
had unlawfully attempted to deprive the Protestants of
their offices, and that they had given proof of this when
they deprived that noble Bohemian hero, Count Thurn,
of his office as burgrave of the Karlstein, which office
the Lord of Sme&#269;no (Martinic) had usurped; he had
done this contrary to the constitution of the land. For
who had ever heard that in Bohemia officials could be
dismissed and offices redistributed without the consent
of the Diet and a vote of the three Estates? 'But you,'
he said, 'worthless disciples of the Jesuits, you with
your followers and little secretaries,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> you have dared to
take it on yourselves to do this, not knowing how otherwise
to harm us and to disparage our party. But you
shall learn that we are not old women'&mdash;and here he
snapped his fingers at them&mdash;'and that we shall not
allow you to deceive us. For we consider you as of
rank equal to our own, but we recognise his Majesty as
our most gracious lord, and being now well satisfied
with him, we shall undertake nothing against his Majesty.
As long as old men, honest and wise, governed this
kingdom, everything went well in it; but since you,
disciples of the Jesuits, have pushed yourselves forward,
the contrary has been the case. You will not be able
to take from us the privileges which God has given us
and our gracious sovereign has confirmed; we will not
till we are conquered consent to this.'"</p>

<p>The indignation of Count Schlick and his intense
excitement, which render his speech at times incoherent,
appear very clearly from Sk&aacute;la's account. The various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>opinions of the nobles assembled in council are very
clearly and minutely set forth.</p>

<p>I have only space for the final passage: "Then while
he (Kinsky) still wished to continue his speech, Count
Thurn quickly approached Slavata and seized him by
the hand, while Ulrick Kinsky seized Martinic&mdash;but
many nobles did not yet know what would be done
with them, whether they would be thrown into a
dungeon or merely put under arrest; then they (Thurn
and Kinsky) led them right through the crowd of
nobles; and only then did every one know that they
would be thrown from the windows. They also now
understood that the Estates were not jesting with them,
though in consequence of their haughtiness and obstinacy
they had as yet spoken to no one; they now began
to entreat that their lives be spared; wringing their
hands and invoking the name of God, they strove to
keep their feet on the ground and begged for mercy.</p>

<p>"The Lord of Sme&#269;no mournfully entreated that he
might be granted a confessor; he received the short
answer that he should commend his soul to God.
Slavata did not ask for a confessor, but prayed to the
Lord to be with him.</p>

<p>"But no mercy was granted them, and first the Lord
of Sme&#269;no was dragged to that window near which the
secretaries generally worked, for Kinsky was quicker and
had more aid than Count Thurn, who had first seized
Slavata. Then they were both thrown, dressed in their
cloaks and with their rapiers and decorations, just as they
had been found in the Chancellor's office, one after the
other head foremost out of the westward window into
the moat beneath the palace, which by a wall is separated
from the other deeper moat. They loudly screamed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
'Ach, ach, ouv&eacute;,' and attempted to hold on to the
window-frame, but were at last obliged to let go, as they
were struck on the hands. They were thus punished
for having been unworthy of their offices and positions,
which they had not sufficiently valued, and had indeed
used to the detriment of His Imperial Majesty and to the
ruin of their country; and this, said the Estates in their
larger apology, was done according to ancient precedents
in the Bohemian kingdom and in the city of Prague, and
following the example of that which was done to Jezebel,
the tormentor of the Israelite people, and also that of the
Romans and other celebrated nations, who were in the
habit of throwing from rocks and other elevated places
those who disturbed the peace of the commonwealth."</p>

<p>As already stated, the part of Sk&aacute;la's enormous work
which is of general interest ends with the execution of
the Bohemian leaders, which took place at Prague on
June 21, 1621. Sk&aacute;la had fled from his country immediately
after the battle of the White Mountain, and thus
undoubtedly escaped sharing the fate of those whose last
moments he has so graphically described. He had therefore
to rely on the information from Bohemia that reached
him in his exile at Freiberg. He tells us, however, that
he has "given word by word the narrative of three
clergymen who were with the prisoners to the end and prepared
them for the violent and, in the eyes of the world,
dishonourable death that awaited them." Here also I
can only give a short extract from Sk&aacute;la's very lengthy
account. He writes: "Then the imperial executioners
appeared before the lords, saying that the hour of death
had come, that they should be ready, and that each one
whose name was called should come out (of the prison).
Immediately afterwards the judges entered the prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
and called out the name of Count Schlick. With them
arrived four German priests, and when they had descended
the steps, two Jesuits stood there, one of whom
was called Sudetius. He said to the Count, 'Domine
Comes recordare adhuc.' But the Count answered
sharply, 'Jam me facias missum.'</p>

<p>"After him they called out the name of Venceslas of
Budova. He took no clergyman with him.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile Harant of Pol&#382;ic sent for John the clergyman,
asking him to come, as it would soon be his turn.... Then
Lord Harant said, sighing, 'O my dear God,
through how many lands have I travelled, how many
dangers have I encountered, for how many days have I
not seen bread; once I have been buried in the sands.
From all these perils God has rescued me, and now
I must die guiltless in my own dear land. Forgive my
enemies, O my dear Lord,' Then they called out his
name, and he started for that mournful stage and
slaughterhouse of Antichrist.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>"But this is worthy of notice, that when one of these
holy men and martyrs for God's cause was called forth,
then to our great astonishment a leave-taking occurred
in a pleasant manner, which rejoiced our hearts, just
as if they were preparing to go to a banquet or some
pastime. 'Now, my dear friends, may our Lord God
bless you, may He grant you the consolations of the
Holy Ghost, patience and courage, so that you may be
able to prove, now also in the moment of your death, that
you have heartily and bravely defended the honour of
God. I go before you that I may first see the glory of
God, the glory of our beloved Redeemer, but I await
you directly after me; already in this hour earthly grief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>vanishes, and a new heartfelt and eternal gladness
begins.' The other prisoners who remained behind
answered, 'May our Lord God bless you on your way
for the sake of the guiltless death of Christ; may He
send His holy angels to meet your soul. You go before
us to the glory of heaven. We also will follow you, and
we are certain because of Him in whom we have believed,
Jesus Christ, that we shall all meet again to-day
and rejoice for ever with our beloved Redeemer, the
angels, and the chosen of God. '... But let us return
to the account of the last journey and the words of the
dying. When leaving the prison-room Harant said, 'In
thee, my God, I have believed since my youth; do not
let me be disgraced for all ages.' Meanwhile, John the
clergyman was saying prayers till they reached the place
of execution, then Harant said, lifting his eyes heavenwards,
'Into your hands, Lord Jesus Christ, I commend
my soul.' He then took off his cloak, and then again
prayed, 'In you, O God, I have believed since my youth,
and therefore I now and ever believe and feel certain
that, in memory of the shameful death of your Son and
my Redeemer, Jesus Christ, you will deign to recompense
me for this temporary disgrace by perpetual
glory; and therefore, O God, I commend my soul into
Thy hands, for Thou hast redeemed it. True God!
Lord Jesus Christ! Son of the living God! Receive my
soul; I commend it to you, O Lord Jesus Christ.' And
then he was beheaded, and exchanged this wretched
earthly life for a glorious and heavenly one.</p>

<p>"And the executioner, who was himself a Utraquist,
was careful not to interrupt their prayers; and he
always waited till each of them had finished his
devotions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the last years of Sk&aacute;la we have little knowledge;
the last documents referring to him mention him as still
living at Freiburg, and date from the year 1640. It is
probable that he died shortly after that time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William</span> Count <span class="smcap">Slavata</span> (born 1572, died 1652), contemporary
of Sk&aacute;la, was also a very voluminous writer.
His life belongs to the political history of Bohemia, and
I shall here only allude briefly to it, because of its close
connection with the writings which Slavata has left.</p>

<p>Slavata's father belonged to the community of the
Bohemian Brethren, and he was himself educated in the
doctrines of that Church. He afterwards proceeded to
Italy for the purpose of study. He there joined the
Roman Church, which obtained in him a most able and
enthusiastic adherent. With the proverbial zeal of a
convert, he, almost alone among the Bohemian nobles,
refused to affix his signature to the celebrated "letter
of majesty," by which King Rudolph, in 1609, granted,
in agreement with the Estates, considerable rights and
privileges to the Protestants. When the weak and sickly
King Matthew, during the last years of his life, fell more
and more under the influence of his heir, Archduke
Ferdinand of Styria, Slavata rapidly obtained high office.
He held the office of Lord Chief-Justice at the beginning
of the Bohemian troubles in 1618. On the memorable
day of the defenestration, Slavata was thrown from the
windows of the Hrad&#269;in together with his colleague, the
burgrave of the Karlstein, Martinic, Lord of Sme&#269;no.</p>

<p>After the re-establishment of the Habsburg dynasty in
Bohemia, Slavata was rewarded for his fidelity by the
victors. He held various important offices of state under
the Emperors Ferdinand II. and Ferdinand III., and was
one of the most trusted councillors of both these sove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>reigns.
His literary work is an incidental and accidental
episode in his momentous career.</p>

<p>When accompanying the Emperor Ferdinand II. to
Regensburg in 1636, a pamphlet written by his old
antagonist, Count Thurn, came into Slavata's hands.
It dealt with the recent assassination of Wallenstein,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
but Thurn's pamphlet went far beyond the immediate
subject, and, in fact, contained a defence of the author's
political career. Slavata immediately resolved on refuting
this work, written by the originator of the defenestration.
Though sixteen years had passed since
that event, and both Bohemian Protestantism and
Bohemian independence had been totally suppressed,
the memory of his ignominious exit from the windows
of the Hrad&#269;in still rankled in Slavata's mind. It should
also be mentioned that several of his friends, his old
companion Martinic in particular, had previously urged
him to write memoirs of his time; he had, however,
always declined to do so because of the stress of public
business.</p>

<p>Slavata's work, intended merely as a refutation of the
statements of Thurn (whose pamphlet he has in its
entirety incorporated into his book), became a historical
work consisting of two volumes of considerable
size.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The book, entitled <i>Pam&#283;ty</i> or memoirs, deals only
with the events of the years 1618 and 1619. Founded,
as it undoubtedly is, on notes taken by Slavata at the
time of the stirring events which he relates, it has the
greatest historical value. Slavata was in correspondence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>with most of the leaders of the "Catholic reformation,"
as the suppression of Protestantism in Bohemia was
officially designated. He has also transcribed many of
the state documents which in his official capacity were
accessible to him. His book is therefore valuable as a
"Quellenwerk," and the historians who have in the
present century rewritten the history of Bohemia have
availed themselves largely of these memoirs. The whole
system of the "Catholic reformation" appears very
clearly in Slavata's book. It should be stated&mdash;though
I run the risk of transgressing on the domain of history&mdash;that
in the question which immediately caused the
Bohemian movement the Protestants had the law on
their side. The defenestration, in fact, only precipitated
a conflict that was in any case inevitable. The only
alternative would have been peaceful submission to the
Church of Rome, such as Ferdinand had obtained in his
hereditary lands, Styria and Carinthia.</p>

<p>It was, of course, Slavata's task to prove that the Protestants
had been the aggressors, and he devotes much
ingenuity and more sophistry to that task. I have before
stated that in my opinion extensive quotations are an
absolute necessity when writing of a literature such as
that of Bohemia, where it may be assumed as a certainty
that almost all the works mentioned are entirely unknown
to the reader. This is, however, particularly
difficult in the case of Slavata, whose writings are distinctly
and constantly controversial, and whose style is
entirely devoid of grace. I shall, as characteristic of
Slavata, translate a portion of his account of the banquet
which the officials of King Frederick gave to the
Turkish ambassador on his arrival at Prague. Slavata
is as long-winded as most of his contemporaries, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
even a very condensed extract of his account may, I fear,
appear lengthy.</p>

<p>Slavata writes: "Some of the officers of the so-called
King Frederick, Bohemians of the Utraquist Church,
gave in the evening a banquet to the Turkish ambassador,
and among them was Henry Matthew, Count
Thurn. The envoys of the Prince of Transylvania
were also present, and of others Bohuchval of Berka,
master of the ceremonies; Venceslas William of Ruppa,
high chancellor; Venceslas of Budova, president of the
court of appeal; Peter Miller, vice-chancellor of the
Bohemian kingdom. At this banquet various speeches
were made. There was one present who has reported
that he heard with his own ears these words that were
spoken there.</p>

<p>"The Turkish ambassador, holding a glass of wine
in his hand, drank it off to the health of Berka, begging
him to consider him as his son, for both alive and
dead, he said, he would be an obedient son to him.
Berka gave as answer that he did not consider himself
as being worthy that the ambassador and envoy
of the great and powerful Turkish emperor should
accept him as his father, he would rather wish to be
his (the ambassador's) willing servant and menial.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
The Turkish ambassador accepted this, and answered
further, saying that he was a Turk by birth and would
die as such; he, however, firmly and certainly thought
that those who believed in Christ will be redeemed,
even though they differed in opinion among themselves.
Of the Emperor Ferdinand, however, he did not believe
that he would be redeemed, for he had been the cause
that the blood of many innocent people had been shed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>and of their destruction. He therefore thought that
the devil would fry him on a spit in hell. Berka then
said that he hoped the Lord God would bless his
beloved lord for this pledge; no toast had ever yet
pleased him so much as this one, and his only wish
was that that should happen to the Emperor Ferdinand,
the greatest enemy of the Bohemians, which the
Turkish ambassador had said; and he added, 'Amen!
Amen! Amen!'</p>

<p>"The same Turkish envoy then exhorted the Bohemian
nobles that they should never submit to the
Emperor Ferdinand; if they were not sufficiently strong,
his emperor would send 60,000 men to their aid.... Berka
further said that he knew for a certainty that
the Emperor Ferdinand would willingly give 50,000
ducats so that he might obtain his head; but that his
friends would give the troops 200,000 ducats that they
might fight Ferdinand till he was totally defeated and
driven to despair. To this the Turkish ambassador
answered that he would act wisely and justly in doing
so, for Ferdinand had not held his word and promise,
just as his predecessors of the House of Austria, Rudolph
and Matthew, had not kept their promises to his Majesty,
the Ottoman emperor.</p>

<p>"Berka then declared that the House of Austria had
always been the ruin of Bohemia, because by its false
Spanish practices it had sold the kingdom, his beloved
fatherland, into perpetual servitude and made slaves
and serfs of the Bohemians. Therefore the kind Lord
God would not allow this any longer, nor permit that
such tyranny and cruelty should be practised against
them; but He in His great mercy had opened their
eyes, and they had therefore taken up arms against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Ferdinand and began war against the House of Austria.
And rather than succumb to Spanish tyranny they would
a thousand times rather submit to the rule and government
of the Turkish emperor, their powerful lord....
Venceslas of Budova, then president of the court of
appeal, who was attached to the Turkish ambassador
as special commissioner, declared that the lords and
other members of the Estates of Bohemia belonging to
the Utraquist creed had arrived at this resolution and decision,
that they would rather be cut to pieces together with
their wives and children than submit to the rule and
domination of Ferdinand, or of any other member of
the House of Austria.... Peter Miller, then vice-chancellor
of the Bohemian kingdom, said to Budova:
'My kind lord father, we Bohemians have resolved,
rather than that the Emperor Ferdinand should be our
king&mdash;and supposing that the Turkish emperor is not
able to help us sufficiently&mdash;we will seek refuge with the
devil in hell and supplicate him to help us.'</p>

<p>"At last Count Thurn spoke, saying that the Lord
God was his witness how truly he regretted with his
whole heart that the Emperor Ferdinand should have
been spoken of in such a manner; but that Ferdinand
had been misled by listening to the counsels of the
Jesuits; neither he nor the other Bohemians were responsible
for his fall; rather should he attribute it to
himself. Then Thurn ordered three small glasses of
wine and one larger glass that was empty, and said,
addressing the Turkish ambassador: 'I drink these three
glasses with you, one to the health of his Majesty the
Emperor (of Turkey), one to the health of our own
most gracious King, and one to that of the Prince of
Transylvania.' And raising the three glasses he poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
their contents into the large empty glass, and then continued:
'As with wine mixed out of three glasses it
cannot be known what wine was in the first, what in
the second, and what in the third glass, and only one
sort of wine appears in this full glass, thus I begin to
drink this glass full of wine in the name of the most
Holy Trinity, consisting of three persons, but one
Divinity, in the hope that these three potentates to
whose health I am drinking will be of one accord, of one
heart, and of one will; so that they may triumph over
and defeat all their enemies.' Then he emptied the full
glass of wine. The Turkish ambassador answered that
he had great pleasure in emptying his glass to this toast.</p>

<p>"From this account and information we can understand
to what evil, heresy especially that of Calvin, leads
people; yet Count Thurn in his pamphlet attempts to
prove that the Bohemians and he, their leader, were not
rebels. I do not endeavour to exaggerate the shameless
rebellion of the Bohemians of those days; for every one
who has read these lines must shudder at the speeches
that were made at Count Thurn's banquet. Nothing
more shameless or wicked can be imagined; nor is it
true that his Majesty Ferdinand II. had not kept his
word and promises."</p>

<p>As Slavata and all his friends were then in exile, it
is not very clear to whom this highly-coloured and
obviously exaggerated account of Count Thurn's banquet
should be attributed. It is possible that some
traitor may have been present who was Slavata's authority.
It is, however, far more probable that the account
is founded on the report of some servant who waited at
table. In consequence of the habit of drinking freely
at banquets, which was then very prevalent in Bohemia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
much political information could be obtained by listening
to the conversation at the dinner-table. The Protestants
frequently accused the Catholics of employing
servants as spies on such occasions.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Whatever Slavata's
authority may be, the passage describing the Bohemian
leaders as cringing in a servile fashion before the representative
of the enemy of Christianity, while displaying
blind and brutal hatred of the House of Habsburg, is a
masterpiece of skilful animosity.</p>

<p>The composition of these memoirs seems to have
inspired Slavata with a taste for historical studies. In
the last years of his life he wrote a vast history of all
the lands ruled by the House of Habsburg, from the
reign of Ferdinand I. to Slavata's own time. This book,
entitled <i>Historick&eacute; Spisovani</i> ("Historical Works"), consists
of fourteen volumes, and the earlier memoirs were
incorporated with it, forming (of course not in chronological
order) volumes i. and ii. The work includes a
lengthy treatise on the long-disputed question whether
the Bohemian kingdom was an elective or a hereditary
one, a question which the battle of the White Mountain
settled "by blood and iron." Slavata here displays a
considerable amount of erudition, though the arguments
founded on his accounts of the reigns of the almost
entirely mythical early Pr&#283;myslide princes are, of course,
valueless. Generally speaking, Slavata's record of earlier
events, based principally on such doubtful authorities
as &AElig;n&aelig;as Sylvius and Hajek, do not possess the historical
value which undoubtedly belongs to his personal
recollections.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>
<p>Though written in Latin, Andreas ab Habernfeld's
<i>Bellum Bohemicum</i> and Paulus Stransky's <i>Respublica</i>
<i>Bojema</i> should at least be mentioned, as they belong
to this period. Habernfeld, who himself took part in the
last war waged by Bohemia as an independent country,
and was present at the battle of the White Mountain,
has left us a clear though prejudiced account of the
events of the years 1618 to 1620. Paulus Stransky, one
of the many Bohemian Protestants who ended their lives
as exiles, has given a short but lucid account of the
ancient Bohemian constitution, and in the same volume
a short history of his country.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />

THE REVIVAL OF BOHEMIAN LITERATURE</h2>


<p>The misery and degradation of Bohemia that were the
result of the battle of the White Mountain are beyond
all description. Perhaps no country has, in comparatively
modern times, suffered as Bohemia did at that
period. Gindely, than whom no historian is less given
to exaggeration, has written: "The misery under which
the land (Bohemia) groaned can, as regards its extent
and its depth, be compared only to that which, at the
time of the migration of nations (<i>V&ouml;lkerwanderung</i>),
was inflicted on the inhabitants of Gaul and Northern
Italy by their Frank and Lombard conquerors." From
the battle of the White Mountain, Bohemian literature
becomes, and continues for many years, an almost complete
blank.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the great destruction of
Bohemian books, so frequently alluded to in these
pages, began, though it continued far into the eighteenth
century. Catholic priests, generally Jesuits, accompanied
by soldiers, visited the houses of the Bohemians; even
the cottages of the peasants were not exempt. As these
priests were generally unacquainted with the Bohemian
language, it was thought best to destroy all books written
in that language. The famous, or rather infamous, destroyer
of Bohemian books, the Jesuit Konias, continued
his bonfires&mdash;he boasted of having burnt 60,000 Bohe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>mian
volumes&mdash;up to the year 1760. It is, of course,
only possible to attempt conjectures as to the value of
the lost works, but Bohemian writers agree in thinking
that many had considerable historical merit. Second, of
course, to non-Roman theological writings, the book-destroyers
relentlessly pursued all works of a historical
character which might suggest to the Bohemian people
the contrast between their glorious past and their present
servile and miserable condition. It may be mentioned
as a proof of this, that even the historical work of Pope
Pius II. (&AElig;n&aelig;as Sylvius) which deals with Bohemia
was ordered to be destroyed.</p>

<p>The numerous emigrants from Bohemia continued
indeed for some time, as already mentioned, to write in
the national language, and only the death of Komensk&yacute;
marks the cessation of such writing. In Bohemia itself,
from the fatal year 1620 to the end of the eighteenth
century, no book appeared in the native language that is
worthy of general notice. Jungmann,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> in his patriotic
endeavour to conceal the complete cessation of Bohemian
literature, enumerates many writers of prayer-books,
collections of sermons, and calendars published at this
period. Whatever historical and philological value such
writings may have, they do not belong to literature.</p>

<p>The nobles and the educated classes in Bohemia at
this period wrote&mdash;as far as they wrote at all&mdash;in German
or in Latin. It is curious to note that Bohemian continued
to be spoken long after it had ceased to be
written among all classes of the population. When, in
1697, Peter the Great visited Prague, he was able to converse
with the nobles in his own language, so similar to
that of Bohemia. This would have been impossible a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>century later, and even at the present day more German
than Bohemian is spoken in the salons of the
Bohemian nobility at Prague.</p>

<p>Of the scanty German and Latin works written in
Bohemia during the seventeenth and eighteenth century,
a few are noticeable as having, though indirectly, contributed
to preserve the ancient national memories which
are so inseparably connected with the national language.
The earliest of these writers is the learned Jesuit <span class="smcap">Balbin</span>
or Balbinus, who was born in 1621, a year after the
catastrophe of the White Mountain, and died at Prague
in 1688. His very numerous works, all written in Latin,
deal principally with the history of his country. Balbin's
writings are, of course, in absolute accordance with the
doctrine of Rome, and, besides, teem with legends of
saints, pedigrees of the newly-established nobility of
Bohemia, and other matters that should have insured
him the favour of the ruling powers. Still Balbin found
many difficulties in his path when he attempted to
publish his works. It is hardly doing injustice to the
Government officials if we suppose that these difficulties
were raised, firstly, because it was considered desirable
that the history of Bohemia should be altogether buried
in oblivion; secondly, because Balbin's writings give
evidence of a degree of fairness which necessarily displeased
them. Balbin's fairness has already been alluded
to when referring to the biography of Mili&#269;, which is
contained in his <i>Miscellanea</i>. Balbin's judgment of
Komensk&yacute; also shows a degree of tolerance very unusual
at that time. He writes in his <i>Bohemia Docta</i>:
"He (Komensk&yacute;) published very many works, but
nothing whatever that was directly aimed at the Catholic
Church. Reading his works, it has always seemed to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
that he wrote with so much reflection that he did not
wish to award superiority to any one religion, nor to
condemn any."</p>

<p>Of Balbin's many works we may mention the <i>Miscellanea</i>,
a vast compilation into which he admitted writings
of earlier authors; the <i>Epitome Rerum Bohemicarum</i>, his
most valuable work; the <i>Bohemia Docta</i>; and a curious
work in defence of the Bohemian language entitled
<i>Disertatio Apologetica Lingu&aelig; Slovenic&aelig;</i>. The difficulties
which Balbin encountered when he attempted to publish
his works have already been alluded to. Great objections
were raised, in particular, against the <i>Epitome Rerum</i>
<i>Bohemicarum</i>; but after long negotiations, influential
friends of Balbin induced the Emperor Leopold I. in
1677 to give his consent to the publication of the book.
The <i>Disertatio Apologetica</i>, on the other hand, was totally
condemned by the Austrian authorities, and was, indeed,
only published a century after the author's death.</p>

<p>Another Catholic priest whose historical labours were
valuable for his country was Tomas Pe&#353;ina, who was
ennobled and granted the title of Cechorod (born 1629,
died 1680). The Latin works of Pe&#353;ina, who was a friend
of Balbin, treat principally of Moravia, and are still of
interest. To the eighteenth century belong the German
works of Joseph Bienenberg, which deal with the archaeology
of Bohemia. In 1778 Bienenberg published his
<i>Alterth&uuml;mer in K&ouml;nigreiche B&ouml;hmen</i>, and two years later
his <i>History of the Town of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz</i>. The latter work
has a far wider interest than its name suggests. Bienenberg
gives many interesting details concerning Zi&#382;ka's
wars, and he prints the celebrated "Articles of war" of
the great Bohemian general.</p>

<p>The fact that these and other writers who sympathised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
with the Bohemian people yet wrote in foreign languages,
proves how deep the national language had
sunk. Become little more than an idiom used by the
peasantry in some parts of Bohemia, it was no longer
available for literature of a more elevated character.</p>

<p>Within the second half of the eighteenth century a
change took place. The Emperor Joseph II. was indeed
a determined enemy of the Bohemian national
aspirations, and his regulations, as well as those of the
Empress Maria Teresa, excluded the Bohemian language
from even the humblest schools to a greater extent than
any of their predecessors had attempted to do. On the
other hand, the enlightened mind of the Emperor Joseph
disapproved of the exaggerated system of restriction and
coercion which during the reigns of his predecessors
had been enforced on all the lands of the Habsburg empire,
though it weighed with exceptional heaviness on
Bohemia. During his reign a newspaper written in the
national language was allowed to appear at Prague, a
permission that even since his reign has several times
been refused by Austrian Governments. It was also a
result of the comparative freedom granted by Joseph that
there began to appear new editions of ancient Bohemian
works, and translations of foreign works into Bohemian,
which contributed greatly to regain for Bohemian the
character of a written language. These workers live in
the grateful memory of their countrymen, but it seems
unnecessary to enumerate them in a book written for
non-Bohemian readers. It will be seen, however, that
in the nineteenth century also even the most prominent
writers considered this editing and translating as an important
duty towards their country. During the reign
of Joseph II. the Bohemian Society of Sciences was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
established. The publications of the society at first
appeared in German only&mdash;they are now printed both in
German and in Bohemian&mdash;and German only was used
in its deliberations. Still, the historical studies which
the society published reminded the Bohemians of their
glorious past, and revived the feeling of pride in their
country, which had greatly decreased. It was at the end
of the eighteenth century also that a professorship of
the Bohemian language was established at the University
of Vienna, and somewhat later at that of Prague.</p>

<p>Before referring to the group of men who in the early
years of the present century successfully effected the
revival of the Bohemian language and literature, we
must notice a writer who, though an enthusiastic student
of the Bohemian language, did not believe that that
language would continue, or perhaps rather again become,
one of the languages of Europe that possess an
independent literature. I refer to Joseph Dobrovsk&yacute;.
Born in 1753, his earliest years coincide with the time
when the decadence of the Bohemian language was most
marked. His books, mostly written in German or Latin,
give evidence of a knowledge of the science of languages
that was very unusual at that period. The early education
of Dobrovsk&yacute;, "the patriarch of Slavic philology",
as he was called in later years, was entirely German.
It was only when studying at the "Gymnasium", first
of Deutsch Brod, then of Klattau in Bohemia, that he
acquired some knowledge of the Bohemian language.
An indefatigable worker, he soon devoted his entire
energies to the study of the historical development of
the Bohemian language and of its connection with the
languages of other Slav countries. When very young
Dobrovsk&yacute; became a member of the Society of Jesus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
and after the suppression of that order lived for a few
years as a tutor in families of the Bohemian nobility.
During the later years of his life he, though he had been
ordained as a priest, led the life of an independent
scholar, living either at Prague or in the country residences
of the Bohemian nobles, where he was always a
welcome guest. Palack&yacute; quotes his own remark as to
the uniformity of his life: "What interest," he said, "can
the rather monotonous life of a private person have?
One works, that is, one writes; has one's writing printed;
then rests, and then begins another work of a similar
character."</p>

<p>Dobrovsk&yacute; was entirely devoid of the enthusiasm for
the national language that animated Jungmann, Kollar,
&#352;afa&#345;ik, Palack&yacute;, and the minor writers of the first half
of the present century. He was, on the other hand, a
philologist of the highest rank. Not only the Bohemians,
but all Slav races, are indebted to him for his studies on
Slav philology, a subject which at that period, when even
in Russia the national language had to a great extent
given way to Latin, French, and German, was absolutely
uncultivated. Of his works we may mention the (German)
"Detailed Grammar of the Bohemian Language" (<i>Ausf&uuml;hrliches</i>
<i>Lehrgeb&auml;nde der B&ouml;hmischen Sprache</i>). This
work has become the model of all Bohemian grammars
that were published subsequently, as well as of those of
other Slav nationalities which have recently attained to the
dignity of possessing written languages. The book was
first published in 1809, and again in an enlarged form in
1818. Dobrovsk&yacute;'s "History of the Bohemian Language
and its Older Literature" (<i>Geschichte der B&ouml;hmischen</i>
<i>Sprache und aeltern Literatur</i>) first appeared in 1792,
but subsequently so completely rewritten, that when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
was republished in 1818 it appeared almost a new work.
The book has become somewhat antiquated and incomplete,
as so many Bohemian books have been rediscovered
since it appeared, but it still has considerable
value. While these and other works of Dobrovsk&yacute; were
written in German, he employed the Latin language for
his <i>Institutiones Lingu&aelig; Slavic&aelig; Veteris</i>. In this, his most
important work, Dobrovsk&yacute;, as in his grammar, paved
the way for later workers. The <i>Institutiones</i> have been
the foundation of the work of the many important Slav
philologists of the present century.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that Dobrovsk&yacute; had no
enthusiasm for the Bohemian language, to the development
of which he so largely contributed. His early
recollections carried him back to the time when it was
little more than an idiom used by the peasantry in the
outlying country districts of Bohemia. When, in the
present century, the movement in favour of the national
language acquired greater strength, Dobrovsk&yacute; never
sympathised with it. When the publication of the
<i>&#268;asopis Musea Kr&aacute;lovstv&iacute; &#268;esk&eacute;ho</i> ("Journal of the
Museum of the Kingdom of Bohemia") in Bohemian,
as well as in German, was first discussed, Dobrovsk&yacute;
expressed the wish that the new journal should appear
in German only. It must, in justice to Dobrovsk&yacute;, be
added that in the last years of his life he wrote a few
Bohemian essays for the journal. They are, indeed,
with a collection of letters, the only writings in the
national language which he has left. Dobrovsk&yacute;'s critical
nature and his thorough philological training induced
him to deny from the time of its discovery the
genuineness of the "MS. of Gr&uuml;neberg",<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> an opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>that is now shared by almost all Bohemian scholars.
Dobrovsk&yacute; expressed himself strongly on the subject
He wrote: "It (<i>i.e.</i> the MS.) is a knavery which they
(the "discoverers") committed from hatred of the Germans,
and from exaggerated patriotism, for the purpose
of deceiving themselves and others."</p>

<p>Dobrovsk&yacute; died in 1829, at a time when the question
whether the Bohemian language should live or not was
already decided in the affirmative sense. He had during
the last years of his life become very unpopular among
the Bohemian patriots, but events have proved that
his critical faculties sometimes guided him better than
enthusiasm did others. As a philologist of the Slav
languages Dobrovsk&yacute; was in advance of his time. Etymological
monstrosities, such as Kollar sometimes committed
in his <i>Staroitalia Slavjansk&aacute;</i>, would have been
impossible to Dobrovsk&yacute;.</p>

<p>Very different from the calm scholarly nature of
Dobrovsk&yacute; was the temperament of the four enthusiastic
patriots to whom, with, of course, the co-operation of
minor writers, the revival of Bohemian literature is due.
I refer to Jungmann, Kollar, Safa&#345;ik, and Palack&yacute;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Jungmann</span> was born in 1773 at Hudlice, a
small village near Beroun in Bohemia. As Hudlice was
even then a thoroughly Bohemian village, Jungmann first
acquired his native language; but when sent to school at
Beroun&mdash;where, as indeed everywhere in Bohemia at
that time, the teaching was entirely German&mdash;he almost
forgot Bohemian, and soon found it far easier to express
himself in German. When on a visit to his native village
an old relation playfully accused him of "stammering"
whenever he spoke Bohemian. This remark; as Jungmann
has himself told us, made a great impression on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
the mind of the young student. "From that moment,"
he afterwards wrote, "I became a true Bohemian, at
least to my best knowledge and will." Jungmann's life
was by no means eventful, and requires little notice. He,
soon after finishing his studies, became professor at the
gymnasium of Leitmeritz, from which he was afterwards
transferred to Prague. Here he spent the greatest part
of his life, and died in 1847, a year before revolutionary
events obliged so many Bohemian patriots to emerge
from their seclusion and become popular leaders.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the great activity the Bohemian
writers of this period displayed as editors of the
works of their ancient literature, as well as translators
from the works of more advanced foreign literatures.
The two tasks were closely connected, as the writers
could only render in Bohemian the classical works of
other countries by availing themselves of the rich verbal
treasury which is contained in the works of their own
ancient authors. Jungmann himself at the beginning of
his life became known as a translator, and, in contradiction
with his later vocation, oftenest attempted translations
of poetical works. It may interest English readers
to know that many of Jungmann's translations are from
the English. Of all his translations, that of Milton's
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, written in five-footed trochees, obtained
greatest celebrity. It is really a wonderful achievement,
if we consider that it was written in 1811, when the
Bohemian language was only just awakening from its
winter-sleep of nearly two hundred years. Jungmann also
translated Gray's <i>Elegy in a Churchyard</i>, Goethe's <i>Herman</i>
<i>und Dorothea</i>, and poems by Schiller and B&uuml;rger. From
the French Jungmann translated Chateaubriand's <i>Atala</i>.
It is stated that Jungmann planned a great original poem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
in the national language, but if this is true the plan was
never carried out. In later years Jungmann devoted
whatever leisure his official duties left him to studies of
a scientific, and particularly of a philological character.</p>

<p>Great as were his merits as a translator, the last-named
works constitute his principal claim to the gratitude of
his countrymen. The earlier of the great works of Jungmann
is his <i>History of Bohemian Literature</i>. Jungmann
did not follow Dobrovsk&yacute;'s example, but wrote in Bohemian.
The book was first published in 1825, and a
second enlarged edition appeared in 1849, after the
author's death. The book is scarcely what in the present
day would be called the history of a literature; perhaps
such a task was impossible at the time Jungmann wrote.
Jungmann's history contains an enumeration of all
writers, great or small, of whom writings in the Bohemian
language have been preserved. Jungmann's intense
patriotism induced him to attempt to prove that at almost
all periods works on almost all subjects written in Bohemian
had existed. Every translator of even the most
valueless work, every preacher who had caused even the
most worthless Bohemian sermon to be printed, therefore
finds a place in this book. Yet this very minuteness
and absence of criticism which we find in the book
render it very valuable as a collection of materials; and
even now, seventy years after its first appearance, it is
indispensable to all students of Bohemian literature.
The introductions to each of the "odd&#283;leni" (divisions)
contain a valuable historical and etymological account of
the development of the Bohemian language and literature
in each of the periods into which Jungmann has
divided his history.</p>

<p>Jungmann also wrote numerous literary articles for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
the Bohemian newspapers and reviews, which gradually
sprung up in spite of the constant opposition of the
Austrian Government. These articles contributed greatly
to the success of the Bohemian movement. As I have
noted elsewhere, that movement was, at its beginning,
necessarily a purely literary one. No political paper
that was not directly or indirectly under the control of
the Government, then entirely German in its views, was
allowed to exist.</p>

<p>The second great work of Jungmann that ranks with
his history of Bohemian literature is his vast dictionary
of the Bohemian and German languages, published in
five large volumes between 1835 and 1839. Jungmann's
preparatory studies, both for this work and for the History,
however, began as early as the year 1800. The
work is a monument of indomitable energy and application.
A work such as that of Jungmann would, if
undertaken by a whole academy, have been most meritorious;
but Jungmann worked almost alone, aided only
in the merely mechanical part of his task by a few
students of the University of Prague. His difficulties
cannot be compared with those which the compiler of a
dictionary of a more developed language encounters. A
large part of ancient Bohemian literature, that within
the last fifty years has been carefully edited and published,
could then only be found in MSS. that were
often difficult of access. Jungmann's work contains
words that he only found once or twice in his sources;
it was his desire to include all, for he laboured not only
for the then scanty readers who wished to study the
works of ancient Bohemian literature, but also for the
modern Bohemian writers, whose vocabulary he endeavoured
to enlarge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>Even now, when Bohemian literature has obtained an
almost miraculous development, Jungmann's dictionary
has not been superseded; and the same, as regards completeness
at least, can be said of his <i>History of Bohemian</i>
<i>Literature</i>.</p>

<p>The originators of the Bohemian revival, drawn together
by a common passionate love for the national
language, were mostly on terms of intimacy, and their
correspondence, very voluminous, as was formerly the
custom, gives a very clear insight into the views of the
writers, and the disheartening circumstances under which
they pursued their work. Of Jungmann's letters, the
most interesting are those addressed to Kollar, who will
be mentioned presently, and to Anthony Marek, an intimate
friend of Jungmann, who was one of the minor
Bohemian writers of this period. The degree of intimacy
which existed among the small band of patriots
is well described in one of Jungmann's letters to Kollar,
written in February 1821: "I am writing to-day," he says,
"to our dear &#352;afa&#345;ik also, and to Palack&yacute;. You three
form indeed my most beloved Trinity." The general
impression of Jungmann's letters is distinctly a depressing
one. The writer refers constantly to the incessant,
often very puerile, vexations which he encountered from
the Austrian authorities. Jungmann complains incessantly
of the "censors", and we shall find the same
complaints later when dealing with Palack&yacute;. Every
book published in Austria had at that period to be
previously submitted to the "censure-office" for inspection.
There were two "censors" to each book, one of
whom had to guard against anything contrary to the
views of the Austrian Government being printed, while
the other suppressed everything contrary to the teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
of the Church of Rome. Kollar had sent some sonnets,
that were afterwards printed in his <i>Daughter of Sl&aacute;va</i>, to
Jungmann for the purpose of submitting them to the
censors. Jungmann writes in answer: "The poems
confided to me I should be glad to get published, but
the censure suppresses everything.... Those beautiful
(O most beautiful) parts of your poem which refer to
Sl&aacute;va I cannot even present to the censors without
much danger to the good cause" (<i>i.e.</i> the revival of the
Bohemian language). "The other part also it will hardly
be possible to publish. The other day Ziegler<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> complained
that the censor had struck out thirty sheets
from his writings, even love-songs set to music. We
must touch neither Eros nor politics; such are the
orders and commands of the censure."</p>

<p>Jungmann's letters to Marek, written in a very familiar
manner, also give an interesting insight into the lives and
thoughts of the little group of Bohemian literary men;
they show their intense devotion to the national language,
their firm belief in the solidarity of the Slavic
races, which was intensified by the Russian victories
over Napoleon, their heartfelt delight when one of the
then almost Germanised Bohemian nobles appeared to
be favourable to the national cause, their dissatisfaction
with the Government of Vienna, which always regarded
them with suspicion. To the last-named subject Jungmann
refers in some of his earliest letters to Marek.
Writing on May 29, 1809, he says: "On me truly falls
every burden of human life. On one hand the malice
of neighbours, magistrates, school directors, vintagers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>and ploughers,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> soldiers (who give it me well<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>), and
other ruffians oppress me; on the other hand, I have
little hope of obtaining my object (which, between us,
is to obtain the professorship of physics at the University
of Prague), because of the fearful number of competitors,
and also because of the injustice of the Austrian
Government, which recently transferred to Prague three
professors from Vienna, as if we Bohemians were all
donkeys." ... The passage of the Russian army through
Bohemia naturally greatly interested the Slavic enthusiasts.
On September 24, 1813, Jungmann writes to
Marek: "The Russian troops march through here (Leitmeritz)
constantly. To-day 120,000 (?) are expected,
whose passage will cost the town 9000 florins. I diligently
<i>govorju</i> [Russian for talking] with them, and find
that there are among them very good-natured men, and
that that which is&mdash;principally by Germans&mdash;said of
their stealing and robbing is not their fault, but that
of the badly organised commissariat.... On the whole,
they are not worse than our own soldiers. It will not
be to the disadvantage of the Bohemians that they
should become better acquainted with the Russians.
They will at least know that there are more Slavs in
the world than they fancied." On May 4, 1814, Jungmann
writes to Marek: "The Germans and half-Germans
here" (at Leitmeritz) "are very angry with the newspapers,
because they always&mdash;so they say&mdash;mention the
Russians as if they were everything. This war has
been advantageous to the Slav world, and has contributed
in no slight degree to its advancement. Not in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>vain has Europe learned to know the Slavs and they
Europe. I think the Slav languages will become better
known than they are now. It is already certain, now
that the Muses are establishing their realm in the North.
I must endeavour to obtain a few Russian books.... Perhaps
Count Waldstein<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> will be favourable to the
Bohemians, as he knows Slavic languages. God be
praised there is another nobleman who is not a
German!"</p>

<p>When more peaceful times began, Jungmann's correspondence
deals mainly with literary matters, but he
continues to uphold the principle of solidarity or mutual
intercourse (<i>vz&aacute;jemnost Slovansk&aacute;</i>) between the Slavs.
On January 3, 1827, Jungmann writes to Marek: "Of
what else should I write but of the subject which we
both carry in our hearts&mdash;Slavic literature. Yes, Slavic
literature, I say, for I may at least name in writing to my
friend what in print we can scarcely mention. So low
have we fallen through the misdeeds of our countrymen,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
that we scarcely dare openly to profess that we
are Slavs.... They treat even the word 'Slav' with
great suspicion at the censure-office, and Palack&yacute; has
made it a rule to mention the Slavs as little as possible
in the journal of the Museum.... How little they love
us can be seen by the fact that the censors at Vienna
only gave permission to print an ancient Bohemian
chronicle on condition that it should be printed in Latin
characters and published at a high price, that it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>come into the hands of but few, and of none that are
'unholy' (<i>i.e.</i> whom the Government distrusts).<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> ... We
have pleasanter news from the East. According to a
letter of &#352;afa&#345;ik, the treaty of Akjerman between Russia
and Turkey guarantees freedom to the Servian nationality;
so a new epoch for that nation and its literature
may begin. At four Russian universities&mdash;Petersburg,
Moscow, Kazan, and Charkov&mdash;professorships of general
Slavic literature will be founded, and one at Warsaw is
also in contemplation. There, then, the Bohemian language
will be heard and its best works published. The
Englishman Povring,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> is translating Servian songs into
English, and, stimulated by &#352;afa&#345;ik, he will also translate
the MS. of K&ouml;niginhof. In England very many are
learning Slavic languages, particularly Russian. Whenever
a learned Englishman acquires a taste for one
Slavic dialect, he wishes to learn a second," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> As a
last quotation from Jungmann's letters, I shall give a
short extract from one written in 1837, which is curious
as referring to Count Kolovrat, one of the founders
of the Bohemian Museum, who was then one of the
principal members of the Austrian cabinet. It proves
that Jungmann was by no means hostile to the Austrian
Government, except when that Government treated its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>Slav subjects unjustly. Jungmann writes: "Gay,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> the
Croatian, is at Karlsbad. The Hungarians wished to
imprison him because he published some national
songs; now to their great grief he has received permission
from Vienna to establish a printing-press. Our
Kolovrat obtained this favour for him, though the
Hungarian Chancellor opposed it. This minister (Kolovrat)
has acted like a true Slav. Thanks and glory to
him!"</p>

<p>Closely connected with Jungmann is his friend Kollar,
whose name has already been mentioned frequently in this
chapter. He was the greatest poet of the early Bohemian
revival, though living Bohemian poets have undoubtedly
surpassed him. <span class="smcap">John Kollar</span> (1793-1852) was born at
Mo&#353;ovec, in the Slav district of Northern Hungary. His
parents were Protestants, and it was decided that he
should become a minister of that Church. In 1815 he
proceeded to the then famous University of Jena in Germany,
for the purpose of finishing his theological studies.
The University of Jena was then one of the centres of the
movement in favour of the unity of the German race,
which has since been effected by "blood and iron". It
does not seem improbable that the contact with the
German patriots laid the germ of Kollar's passionate
devotion to the idea of the unity of the Slav nations;
though of course it was of a literary, not a political union
of these nations&mdash;that are separated from each other by
millions of aliens&mdash;that Kollar dreamt. It is, however,
anticipating the future if we assume that these ideas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>exclusively, or even principally, occupied young Kollar
while at Jena. An event during his stay at Jena influenced
his whole life, and became the origin of the only
one of his works that will live. He became passionately
attached to Mina (or Wilhelmina) Schmidt, the daughter
of a Protestant clergyman who lived in a village near
Jena. How the German country girl was by Kollar
transformed into the <i>Daughter of Sl&aacute;va</i> is one of the
curiosities of literature. Kollar's suit for Mina Schmidt
was for the present unsuccessful. Frau Schmidt declared
that she would never allow her daughter to live
in a "savage country," as she termed Hungary; and it
was to that country that Kollar's ecclesiastical career
obliged him to return. Kollar afterwards became minister
to the Protestant Church at Pest, and continued
there up to the year 1849. He corresponded with Mina
for some time after his departure from Jena, but news&mdash;incorrect,
as it afterwards turned out&mdash;was brought from
Germany announcing Mina's death. The news proved
untrue, and fifteen years after Kollar's departure from
Jena, and some years after he had raised Mina to the
Slav heaven, she became his wife. Kollar's life, like that
of all the Bohemian patriots, was a very laborious and
painful one. His letters contain constant complaints of
the incessant persecutions on the part of the Hungarian
Government which his Slav sympathies brought on him.
A plot on the part of Hungarians to murder Kollar was
even discovered. Kollar several times appealed, and
appealed successfully, to the Emperor Francis I. for
protection. Kollar's ideas of Slavic solidarity also resulted
mainly in disappointment. The separation of
the Slavs on the whole continued as before, and even
Kollar's own language, the Bohemian, was abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
by Kollar's own countrymen. The Slavs of Northern
Hungary, identical in race with the Bohemians and Moravians,
had always used the Bohemian language. &#352;afa&#345;ik,
as well as Kollar himself, both born in the Slavic
districts of Hungary, wrote in Bohemian. In the present
century only the Slavs of Northern Hungary
adopted as a written language a dialect that slightly
differs from Bohemian. The result of this injudicious
step, which Kollar from the first strongly blamed, has
been the almost complete absorption by the Magyars of
the isolated Slavs of Northern Hungary.</p>

<p>During the Hungarian revolution Kollar left Pest.
Like most Slavs, his sympathies were rather with the Austrians
than with the Hungarians, who had, indeed, constantly
persecuted him. He spent some time travelling
in Germany and Italy. One of the results of his visit
to the last-named country was that deplorable work,
<i>Staroitalia Slavjansk&aacute;</i> ("Slavic Ancient Italy"). In recognition
of his faithfulness to the Austrian Government,
Kollar, immediately after the suppression of the
Hungarian revolution in 1849, was awarded the professorship
of Slavic archaeology at the University of
Vienna. He did not live long to enjoy the comparative
prosperity of which he was now assured. He died at
Vienna on January 24, 1852, leaving his wife and children
in a state of great destitution.</p>

<p>Kollar's <i>Sl&aacute;vy Deera</i> ("Daughter of Sl&aacute;va") perhaps
contributed more than any other work to the revival of
Bohemian literature. Its first appearance was received
with great enthusiasm, which continued for many years.
Some of the Bohemian patriots boasted that they knew
the whole enormous collection of sonnets by heart.
The book, at first a small collection of sonnets, gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
grew to one of the largest books consisting entirely
of sonnets which exists. The first collection was published
in 1821, and consisted principally of reminiscences
of Mina and of Jena, though Kollar's enthusiasm
for the Slav race also already finds expression here. It
was impossible that so fervent a Slav should love a
German girl, but Kollar discovered that the family of
Schmidt had come to Thuringia from Lusatia, which
was formerly a Slav country, and where, indeed, a Slav
dialect lingers to the present day. Mina thus being a
Slav, it was possible to celebrate her as the "Daughter
of Sl&aacute;va", a goddess who personifies the Slavic race.
Kollar firmly maintained that such a goddess had existed
in the heathen mythology of the Slavs, but recent and
more critical writers have expressed doubts on the subject.
At any rate, Kollar gave the name of the <i>Daughter</i>
<i>of Sl&aacute;va</i> to the second and enlarged edition of his
sonnets, which appeared in 1824. While the first collection
had consisted mainly of love songs, the national
Slav motive now becomes equally prominent. Kollar was
greatly struck by the fact that large parts of Northern
Germany, including the country near Jena, where Kollar
had first loved and written, were formerly inhabited by
Slavs. Constant warfare with the Germans, which began
at the time of Charles the Great, has indeed long since
destroyed all trace of these Slavs, but Kollar's imagination
recalled them to life. Though very little is known
of the Slav inhabitants of Northern Germany, there is no
doubt that Kollar has greatly idealised them. The edition
of the <i>Daughter of Sl&aacute;va</i> published in 1824 consisted of
three cantos. The poet, accompanied by Milek (the
Slavic god of love), who has descended from heaven to
bring him news of Mina, visits the countries that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
watered by the Saale, the Elbe, and the Danube, and the
three rivers give their names to the three cantos. Kollar
and his companion everywhere search and find traces
of the former Slav inhabitants of the countries which
they visit. The edition of 1824 first contained the "fore-song"
(<i>p&#345;edzp&#283;v</i>), or introduction, written in distichs, in
which Kollar bewails the fate of the early inhabitants of
Northern Germany. These verses rank among the finest
in the whole range of modern Slav poetry. In 1832
Kollar published a third, again enlarged, collection of
his sonnets. The second canto was considerably added
to, and now entitled <i>The Elbe, the Rhine, and the Vltava</i>.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
Two new cantos were added under the names of <i>Lethe</i>
and <i>Acheron</i>. Kollar chose those names to give unity to
his poem, as the former cantos had also been named
after rivers. But the two new cantos are really a Slavic
<i>Paradiso</i> and <i>Inferno</i> modelled on Dante. Kollar has
here glorified and stigmatised those whom he considered
prominent friends or enemies of the Slav race. It must
be confessed that large portions of these cantos consist
in a mere enumeration of names, often of persons who
have long sunk into oblivion. Thus we find in hell a
Miss Pardoe, who wrote a long-forgotten book of travels
in Hungary, in which she, it appears, adopted the Hungarian
standpoint, always hostile to the Slavs. Kollar,
in his new peregrinations, is no longer accompanied by
Milek, but by the "Daughter of Sl&aacute;va," the glorified
Mina Schmidt. The last sonnet of the poem, which I
shall translate, contains an appeal of the "Daughter of
Sl&aacute;va" to all her countrymen, exhorting them to concord.</p>

<p>Though no subject could then be more original than
the glorification of the then little-known Slav races,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>Kollar's poem yet contains many reminiscences of other
writings. It has already been stated that the leading
idea of the two last cantos is borrowed from Dante.
The pilgrim in the earlier cantos sometimes recalls
<i>Childe Harold</i>. Mina, or the "Daughter of Sl&aacute;va," is
sometimes modelled on Beatrice, sometimes on Laura.
Kollar indeed never made a secret of the fact that he
had studied the poetry of Western Europe. Such study
was indeed a necessity at a time when, with the exception
of the songs of the people, the Slavs possessed
no poetry. Bohemian critics agree in asserting that
the first canto of the <i>Sl&aacute;vy Deera</i>, written under the
influence of a passionate love for Mina, is infinitely the
best. The introduction to the poem has also been
justly admired. It is interesting also as containing a
general exposition of the author's views and dreams
concerning the past and future of the Slavic race.
Want of space will oblige me to quote only a portion
of the "fore-song." Kollar, viewing the former homes
of his race, exclaims: "Here before my tearful eyes
lies the land, Once the cradle, now the tomb, of my
nation. Stop! it is holy ground on which you tread.
Son of the Tatra (Carpathian mountains), raise your
head towards heaven, Or rather guide your steps towards
that oak-tree Which yet defies destructive Time.
But worse than Time is man, who has placed his iron
sceptre on thy neck, O Sl&aacute;va; Worse than wild war,
more fearful than thunder, than fire, Is the man who,
blinded by hate, rages against his own race.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> O ancient
times that surround me as with night! O land that
art a record of all glory and all shame! From the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>treacherous Elbe to the perfidious plains near the
Vistula, From the Danube to the devouring waves of
the Baltic, In all these lands the harmonious language
of the brave Slavs once resounded. Succumbing to
hatred, it now has perished. And who has committed
this offence that cries to heaven for vengeance? Who
has in one nation dishonoured humanity in its entirety?
Blush, envious Germany, the neighbour of Sl&aacute;va! It
is thy hands that once committed this guilty deed. No
enemy has spilt so much blood&mdash;and ink, As did the
German to destroy the Slavs. He who is worthy of
liberty respects the liberty of all. He who forges irons
to enslave others is himself a slave. Be it that he
fetters the language or the hands of others, It is the
same; he proves himself unable to respect the rights
of others...." Kollar then proceeds to give the idealised
account of the ancient Slav inhabitants of Germany,
to which I have already referred. He attributes to
them a very advanced degree of culture, and describes
them as instructing Europe in seamanship, agriculture,
and mining. Enumerating the Slav tribes, he writes:
"Whither have you vanished, dear Slav nations, Nations
that once drank the waters of Pomerania and the Saale,
Peaceful tribes of the Sorbs, descendants of the Obotrites?
And you tribes of the Ukres and Wiltes, whither
have you gone? I look far to the right, I glance to
the left, But in vain does my eyes seek Sl&aacute;va in Slavic
land. Tell us, O tree, growing as a temple, under
which sacrifices were once offered to the ancient gods,
Where are the nations, the princes, the towns, Who
first spread civilisation in these northern lands?"</p>

<p>Writing as a poet, not as a politician, Kollar believed
the Germanisation of these ancient Slav lands to be far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
less complete than it actually is. He writes: "As two
rivers, though their waters have joined in one channel,
yet differ in colour during a long part of their course,
thus these two nations (the Germans and Slavs), though
intermingled by the force of fierce war, yet still differ
visibly in their manner of life. But the degenerate sons
of Sl&aacute;va often insult their mother, while they kiss the rod
of their hateful stepmother (Germany). They are neither
Slavs nor Germans in their ways. Hybrids, they belong
half to one race, half to the other. Thus has the race of
Osman settled down in the Hellenic lands. Its horsetails
are prominent on the summit of Olympus. Thus,
too, did the avaricious Europeans ruin the two Indian
worlds, giving the people indeed education, but robbing
them of their virtue, their land, their colour, and their
language. Nationality and honour with us, too, have
disappeared; Nature alone has remained unchanged.
Woods, rivers, towns, and villages would not abandon
their Slav names.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The sound still remains, but the
Slavic spirit has fled...." The introduction ends thus:
"It is shameful when in misery to moan over our fate;
he who by his deeds appeases the wrath of Heaven acts
better. Not from a tearful eye, but from a diligent hand
fresh hope will blossom. Thus even evil may yet be
changed to good. A crooked path may indeed lead men
astray, but not humanity at large. The confusion of
individuals may yet serve to the advantage of the community.
Time changes everything, even past times.
The errors of centuries may yet be repaired by time."</p>

<p>The fame of Kollar's introduction is so great that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>have translated a considerable part of it, and I am therefore
yet more limited in my quotations from the sonnets
themselves. Those of the first canto, where the love-motive
is still strong and enters into a quaint rivalry
with the author's Slav enthusiasm, are the earliest and
most valuable fruits of Kollar's muse. &#268;elakovsk&yacute;<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> was
undoubtedly right in stating that the poetic genius of
Kollar left him with his younger years. In the twelfth
sonnet of the first book Kollar describes his hesitation
between the two subjects that inspired him. There is an
easily noticeable echo of Anacreon in the song. The
poet writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>I wished to sing of the thrones of the Bohemian kings, of the</i>
<i>arrival of the brothers, of Vlasta and Libussa,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> of Attila, the</i>
<i>scourge of God, and how he taught his Huns to use the crossbow.</i></p>

<p>"<i>I wished to sing of the golden Carpathians, the wines of Tokay,</i>
<i>the splendour of the moon; but when I touched the strings of my</i>
<i>lyre, 'Mina,' and again 'Mina,' alone resounded in my ears.</i></p>

<p>"<i>In simple style I wished to write of fables, flowers, kingdoms,</i>
<i>but my pen, self-willed, traces other characters than those that I</i>
<i>intended.</i></p>

<p>"<i>My speech also does not obey my will, and what when in company</i>
<i>my heart carefully conceals my rash tongue reveals.</i>"</p></div>

<p>The singular mixture of love and national enthusiasm
already noted appears quaintly&mdash;it would be severe to
say grotesquely&mdash;in another sonnet of the first book.
Kollar writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>Once when a heavy sleep closed her weary little eyelids, I for</i>
<i>half an hour practised kissing her as a true Slav should.</i></p>

<p>"<i>My kisses were not such as Roman, Greek, or German describes&mdash;sensual</i>
<i>buffooneries. They were pure, proper kisses, such as the</i>
<i>customs of our Russian brothers allow.</i></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>

<p>"<i>Thus then did I kiss my love: from the forehead downward to</i>
<i>the chin, then in the shape of a cross from one little ear to the other.</i></p>

<p>"<i>On this voyage twice I reached the little rose-garden of her lips,</i>
<i>through which my soul enters into hers.</i>"</p></div>

<p>Of the sonnets of the second canto I shall quote one
in which Kollar's enthusiasm for "Slavia," the Slav
world, which he distinguishes from the goddess "Sl&aacute;va,"
appears most clearly. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>Slavia, Slavia! Thou name of sweet sound but of bitter</i>
<i>memory; hundred times divided and destroyed, but yet more</i>
<i>honoured than ever.</i></p>

<p>"<i>From the Ural Mountains to the summit of the Carpathians,</i>
<i>from the deserts near the equator to the lands of the setting sun, thy</i>
<i>kingdom extends.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Much hast thou suffered, but ever hast thou survived the evil</i>
<i>deeds of thy enemies, the evil ingratitude also of thy sons.</i></p>

<p>"<i>While others have built on soft ground, thou hast established</i>
<i>thy throne on the ruins of many centuries.</i>"</p></div>

<p>One of the sonnets of the third book contains a
curious prophecy of the future greatness of the Slav
race. Kollar writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>What will become of us Slavs a century hence? what of all</i>
<i>Europe? Slavic manners, as the floods of a deluge, will extend</i>
<i>their strength in every direction.</i></p>

<p>"<i>That language, which the Germans falsely believed to be but</i>
<i>a dialect fit for slaves, will be heard even under the ceilings of</i>
<i>palaces and in the mouths of our very enemies.</i></p>

<p>"<i>By means of the Slav language science will be developed. Our</i>
<i>dress, the customs, the songs of our people will be the fashion on the</i>
<i>Seine and on the Elbe.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Oh! had it but been granted to me to be born at that time</i>
<i>when the Slavs will rule, or might I at least then rise again from</i>
<i>my tomb!</i>"</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>The recent development of the Slav races is so little
known in England, that these lines will probably appear
to many readers far more absurd than they really are.
Professor L&eacute;ger, who has devoted his life to the study
of Slavic history and literature, and is wondrously in
touch with the national feeling, writes of the sonnet
which I have just quoted: "These lines were written
about the year 1830. Is it necessary to state to how
great an extent the predictions have been fulfilled?
The Slav language, then considered a jargon of peasants,
is now the recognised language of the courts of St.
Petersburg, Belgrade, Sophia, and Cettigne, of the parliaments
and representative bodies of Prague, Br&uuml;nn,
and Agram, of the universities of Russia, Bohemia,
Poland, and Illyria. ... Russian is ardently studied
at Berlin, Paris, Vienna, and Budapest. Muscovite
novels invade the libraries of Paris."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The two last cantos of Kollar's great poem have little
literary merit, and their always rather local interest has,
as I have already mentioned, decreased with the lapse
of time. I shall, however, translate the last sonnet of
the fifth canto, which forms the conclusion of the whole
work. Mina, in heaven, addresses thus the Slavs who
are still on earth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>Oh you, brothers and sweet sisters who yet live in the world,</i>
<i>grant me willingly your ear that I may briefly instruct you.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Beware of that smooth path which the devil has interwoven</i>
<i>with nets that he may entangle the souls of traitors in his deceitful</i>
<i>snares.</i></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
<p>"<i>Come here and find (in heaven and hell) an example in the</i>
<i>good and a warning in the evil. Learn above all to love your</i>
<i>country.</i></p>

<p>"<i>May these words resound from your summits, O Carpathians,</i>
<i>to the &#268;erna Hora (Montenegro), from the Giant Mountains to</i>
<i>the Ural: 'Hell for traitors, heaven for faithful Slavs!'</i>"</p></div>

<p>Kollar's merit as a writer depends mainly on the
"Daughter of Sl&aacute;va," though he was a copious writer
of prose as well as poetry. A small German pamphlet
by Kollar entitled, <i>Ueber die literarische Wechselseitigkeit</i>
<i>zwischen den verschiedenen St&auml;mmen und Mundarten der</i>
<i>Slavischen Nation</i> ("On the Literary Solidarity of the
various Branches of the Slav Nation"), which appeared
in 1837, caused great sensation, and for a time acquired
even political importance. In Bohemian Kollar wrote,
besides his <i>Sl&aacute;vy Deera</i>, an account of his travels in
Germany and Italy and several archaeological works. Of
these, the <i>Staroitalia Slavjansk&aacute;</i> ("Slavic Ancient Italy"),
written in the last year of Kollar's life, and dedicated to
the Emperor Francis Joseph, is the largest. The author
endeavoured, on the slightest evidence and by means of
the most fantastical suppositions, to prove that a large
part of the population of Italy&mdash;particularly in the north&mdash;is
of Slav origin. Kollar is here constantly carried
away by his exuberant imagination, and the book has no
scientific value. It is, indeed, scarcely an exaggeration
to call it a tissue of absurdities. Kollar's recently published
correspondence with Jungmann, &#352;afa&#345;ik, Palack&yacute;,
and others has great interest.</p>

<p>While Kollar devoted to the revival of the Bohemian
language and literature his enthusiastic eloquence and
poetic talents, &#352;afa&#345;ik employed for the same purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
his vast erudition and unusual ability as a philologist.
His works deal principally with the early origins of the
Slav language and race, and of the early literature of
Bohemia. The latter works were very valuable at a
time when the Bohemian language was again acquiring
the dignity of a written language. Like Jungmann,
&#352;afa&#345;ik also endeavoured to forward the advancement
of his language by means of translations from more
cultivated languages, and in his youth he also wrote
poetry. But it is on his philological and archaeological
works on the Slav race that his fame is principally
founded. Equal to Dobrovsk&yacute;, and perhaps superior
to Jungmann in erudition, some of his writings on
these subjects are still standard works.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul Joseph &#352;afa&#345;ik</span> (1795-1861), like Kollar, was
a native of the Slav district of Northern Hungary. As
the son of a Protestant clergyman he received his first
education in his own country, and from his early youth
gave proof of his enthusiasm for the Slavic race, which
inspired him during his whole life. In 1815 he visited
the then far-famed University of Jena in Germany, and
on his return to Hungary accepted a situation as private
tutor at Pressburg. He here became acquainted with
Palack&yacute;, and the friendship that sprang up between them
continued during the whole of their lives. In 1819 &#352;afa&#345;ik
was appointed director of the gymnasium at Nov&yacute; Sad
(Neusatz), in Southern Hungary. His life here was
embittered by constant persecution on the part of the
Hungarian authorities, whose aversion to the Slav aspirations
was as great as that of the German officials in
Austria.</p>

<p>&#352;afa&#345;ik's writings had meanwhile attracted attention at
Prague, and some of the Bohemian patriots, though by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
no means opulent, subscribed a sufficient sum to enable
him to proceed to Prague. His life here also was a
wretched one. He was in constant financial distress.
While occupied with learned works of the highest importance,
he was obliged to gain his living by writing
in popular journals, and he had at one time even to
accept the humiliating and invidious office of a "censor."
Writing on Slav subjects is not at the present day a very
lucrative occupation. It was yet less so at the time of
&#352;afa&#345;ik, when interest in these matters was still more
limited. &#352;afa&#345;ik's health began to fail in consequence
of constant anxiety, but he continued his studies on the
history and language of his country and race undauntedly.
A speaker at the meeting of Bohemian scholars
that in 1895 celebrated the centenary of &#352;afa&#345;ik's birth,
rightly described him as a "martyr of science." While
the Austrian Government continued to regard &#352;afa&#345;ik's
researches with indifference, the attention of the Prussian
authorities was attracted to his profound knowledge of
Slavic philology and archaeology, sciences that were then
in their infancy. &#352;afa&#345;ik was offered a professorship
both by the University of Breslau and that of Berlin,
but the Austrian Government, not wishing that he should
expatriate himself, now appointed him professor of Slavic
philology at the University of Prague. He, however,
gave up this appointment a year later, when he became
librarian of that university. In 1848 &#352;afa&#345;ik made a brief
appearance in the political arena. He was a member of
the Slav congress that met at Prague in that year, and a
speech in favour of the solidarity of the Slav nations which
he delivered there caused great sensation. The failure
of the congress and the German reaction,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> which lasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>from 1849 to 1859, were deeply felt by &#352;afa&#345;ik. He now
confined his studies to the remote antiquity of the Slav
race. Every allusion to Bohemian history of later times
again became inadmissible during these years. &#352;afa&#345;ik,
whose health had long been failing, died on June 2nd,
1861. Some time before his death his mental faculties
had been affected.</p>

<p>I shall only mention a few of the most important
of &#352;afa&#345;ik's numerous writings. His many Bohemian
essays on Slavic philology and archaeology&mdash;mostly published
in the Journal of the Bohemian Museum&mdash;have
indeed inestimable value for those who devote themselves
to these studies, but little interest for others.
&#352;afa&#345;ik's first work was a small collection of Bohemian
songs, written when he was only nineteen-years of age,
and entitled <i>Tatransk&aacute; M&uacute;sa s lyrou Slovanskou</i> ("The
Carpathian Muse with Slavic Lyre"). Early works also
were several translations, of which that of the <i>Clouds</i> of
Aristophanes and that of Schiller's <i>Maria Stuart</i> are the
most important. A work which had already occupied
&#352;afa&#345;ik at Jena, but which he only completed during his
stay at Neusatz, was his German <i>Geschichte der Slavischen</i>
<i>Sprache und Literatur</i> ("History of the Slavic Language
and Literature"). Neusatz or Nov&yacute; Sad, a town in the
south of Hungary, close to the frontier of Croatia, and
not far from that of the present kingdom of Servia, was
situated very favourably for the purpose of studying the
various Slav languages. In his book &#352;afa&#345;ik, contrary
to the now generally accepted method of dividing the
Slavs into three branches, distinguishes two classes of
Slav nations only, and divides his book into two parts
in accordance with this system. The first part deals
with the Old Slavic language, the Russian, Servian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
Croatian languages, and some minor dialects. The
second part contains the history of the Polish and Bohemian
literatures, and notes on the now nearly extinct
dialects of the Slavs of Northern Germany, The book
became antiquated even during &#352;afa&#345;ik's lifetime, and he
planned a new revised and enlarged edition, which was
to have been published in Bohemian. Failing health and
other occupations prevented &#352;afa&#345;ik from carrying out
this work. Even in its first state the book, which was
only reprinted after &#352;afa&#345;ik's death, long remained the
standard authority on the little-known subject of which
it treats. It is only since Mr. Pypin and Mr. Spasovi&#269;;
published in 1865 their (Russian) <i>History of the Slav</i>
<i>Literatures</i> that &#352;afa&#345;ik's work can be considered as
superseded. Another fruit of &#352;afa&#345;ik's residence in the
South Slav countries was his <i>Serbische Lesek&ouml;rner</i>, an
historical and critical analysis of the then little-known
Servian language. This book also was written in German.</p>

<p>During his stay at Prague, &#352;afa&#345;ik produced his most
important work, which rendered him famous in all
Slav countries. I refer to the <i>Staro&#382;itnosti Slovansk&eacute;</i>
("Slavic Antiquity"), which was published in 1837. The
book&mdash;written in Bohemian&mdash;is an attempt to record
the history and culture of the Slavs in the earliest times.
The subject, still very obscure, was then entirely unexplored.
&#352;afa&#345;ik intended the work to consist of two
parts, but only the first, which is purely historical, was
completed. Of the second part, only some essays on the
ancient ethnography and archaeology of the Slavs were
published. The historical work, which &#352;afa&#345;ik again
divided into two parts, deals, in the first, with the history
of the Slav race from the time of Herodotus to the fall
of the West Roman empire. The second part continues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
that history to the time when most Slavs were converted
to Christianity&mdash;that is to say, speaking roughly, to about
the year 1000. &#352;afa&#345;ik's work entirely revolutionised
the then current ideas on the origin of the Slavs and
their early history. The more recent writers who, particularly
in Russia, have studied these subjects, acknowledge
that &#352;afa&#345;ik's great work has been the foundation
of their researches. One of his minor works requires
notice, as it is connected with the much discussed
question of the antiquity of the MSS. of K&ouml;niginhof
and Gr&uuml;neberg. In 1840 &#352;afa&#345;ik published jointly with
Palack&yacute; a German work entitled <i>Die &auml;ltesten Denkm&auml;ler</i>
<i>der B&ouml;hmischen Spracke</i>. In this book the two authors
maintain the ancient origin, not only of the MS. of
K&ouml;niginhof, but also of that of Gr&uuml;neberg, in which
scarcely any Bohemian scholar now believes. Of course
the question had not then&mdash;more than fifty years ago&mdash;been
so thoroughly thrashed out as is now the case.
&#352;afa&#345;ik was an indefatigable worker. Besides his many
published works, a large number of MSS. in his handwriting
dealing with Slavic research were found. They
prove that, had circumstances been more favourable,
and had his health not failed him, he might have produced
yet more works on the subjects to the study of
which he devoted his life.</p>

<p>The works of Jungmann, Kollar, and &#352;afa&#345;ik will always
be highly valued by Bohemians, and indeed by all Slavs.
But the career of Palack&yacute;, the greatest of the Bohemian
leaders, whom I mention last, has a far wider interest,
as have also the contents of his greatest work. Dealing
mainly with Bohemian history, it incidentally throws a
great deal of light on many questions connected with
the general history of Europe up to the year 1526. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
is much to be regretted that English historians have
as yet availed themselves so little of Palack&yacute;'s monumental
<i>History of Bohemia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francis Palack&yacute;</span> was born in 1798 at Hodslavice in
Moravia, not far from P&#345;erov or Prerau, an old centre
of the Unity. The traditions of the Brethren never quite
died out in this part of Moravia. Palack&yacute;'s forefathers
had belonged to the Unity, and the family, during the
many years of persecution, continued secretly to worship
according to its teaching. When the Emperor Joseph II.,
who, as regards religious toleration, was far in advance
of his age, issued a decree authorising Protestant religious
services according to the Augsburg and Helvetic Confessions,
Palack&yacute;'s parents declared their adherence to the
former creed. It may be mentioned that the Bohemian
Brethren have only during the present reign again been
recognised as a religious community. The traces of the
traditions of the Brethren are very noticeable in Palack&yacute;'s
works, particularly in his masterly account of the career
of Hus.</p>

<p>After obtaining the rudiments of education in local
schools, Palack&yacute; in 1812 proceeded to the Protestant
lyceum at Pressburg in Hungary. Here already
Palack&yacute; gave proof of his studious nature, and his
predilection for historical research was already evident
Gifted with the Slav facility for acquiring languages,
Palack&yacute; at Pressburg obtained a thorough knowledge
of the English language. We are told that Bolingbroke's
<i>Letters on the Study and Use of History</i>, Blair's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span><i>Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</i>,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and the historical
works of Robertson and Gibbon were among Palack&yacute;'s
favourite books. Other historical works that he read
with great interest were Karamsin's <i>History of Russia</i>
and Johannes M&uuml;ller's <i>History of the Swiss Confederation</i>.
After finishing his studies at Pressburg, Palack&yacute; continued
to live there for some time, and was engaged
as tutor by several noble families. It was during his
stay at Pressburg that his life-long friendship with
Kollar, that has already been mentioned, began. It
was, indeed, probably mainly through Kollar's influence
that he decided to devote his life to the study of
Bohemian history and literature; he had previously
thought of becoming a minister of the Protestant Church.</p>

<p>Pressburg, and Hungary generally, was not then a
desirable residence for one who intended to devote
himself to Slavic studies, which the Hungarian Government
regarded with marked displeasure. Palack&yacute;,
therefore, travelled to Prague, where he had the good
fortune to obtain the protection of Dobrovsk&yacute;, who
from their earliest acquaintance had realised the exceptional
talent of the young Moravian. Through
Dobrovsk&yacute;'s influence Palack&yacute; obtained from Francis
Count Sternberg the appointment of archivist to the
family of which Count Francis was the head. This
appointment left Palack&yacute; sufficient leisure to pursue
his historical studies, and the small salary attached to
it was very welcome to Palack&yacute;. He had, indeed,
while a tutor, laid by a little money, but that could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>not last long, and his literary work was not likely to
afford him much pecuniary gain. One advantage which
Palack&yacute; obtained by his appointment as archivist to
Count Sternberg will surprise English readers, but his
Bohemian biographers lay great stress on it. Palack&yacute;'s
post secured him against all molestation on the part of the
police. The Austrian police authorities in the earlier part
of the present century were empowered to expel from
any town "strangers of no profession," and they were
particularly likely to do so in the case of a man known
to be favourable to the Bohemian national movement.</p>

<p>In other ways, also, the modest appointment was a
turning-point in Palack&yacute;'s career. Through the favour
of Francis Count Sternberg, and of his brother, Count
Kaspar, president of the Bohemian Museum&mdash;which the
two brothers had, jointly with Count Kolovrat, founded
in 1818&mdash;Palack&yacute; became acquainted with many of the
Bohemian nobles. He succeeded in obtaining from
many of them the then quite exceptional permission
to study the archives contained in their castles. Had
it not been for the researches which he was allowed
to make in these archives&mdash;particularly in those of
Prince Schwarzenberg at Tr&#283;bon or Wittingau&mdash;Palack&yacute;
would have been unable to write his <i>History of Bohemia</i>.
The impulse to write the work, indeed, also came from
the Bohemian nobles. The Diet in 1829 conferred on him
the title of "Historian of the Estates of Bohemia;" but
their legislative authority was very limited, and ten years
passed before the title conferred on Palack&yacute; was confirmed
by the authorities of Vienna.</p>

<p>It was on the suggestion of Palack&yacute; that it was decided
that the newly-founded society of the Bohemian
Museum should publish an annual journal, which was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
contain principally studies on the history, ethnography,
literature, and mythology of Bohemia. After some discussion
as to whether the new journal should appear in
Bohemian or in German&mdash;even so learned a Slavist as
Dobrovsk&yacute; declared that it was impossible to publish
a scientific periodical in the national language&mdash;it was
decided to publish it in both languages. The <i>Journal of</i>
<i>the Museum of the Bohemian Kingdom</i> ("Casopis Musea
Kr&aacute;lovstv&iacute; &#268;esk&eacute;ho") first appeared in 1827, and Palack&yacute;
was its first editor. The German edition, which, though
the great Goethe wrote in its favour, found few readers,
was discontinued in 1831. The version which appeared
in the national language, on the other hand, has been
continued up to the present day. It is invaluable to
those who endeavour to study the history and literature
of Bohemia, and I have used its volumes extensively
while writing this book. Mr. Morfill, one of the few
English writers on Slavic subjects who writes with
thorough knowledge and insight,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> has truly described
the volumes of the journal of the Bohemian Museum
as a "mine of Slavonic lore."</p>

<p>Palack&yacute;'s time up to 1837 was fully occupied with the
duties connected with the editing of the new journal,
with the composition of minor historical writings, and
with his studies in the Bohemian archives. He soon,
however, found that the preparations for his great history
of Bohemia which the Estates urged him to write,
would necessitate study in foreign archives also. Palack&yacute;,
therefore, visited Munich and Dresden, and in
1837 undertook a more extensive journey to Italy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>where he spent considerable time in studying the valuable
documents contained in the archives of Venice and
Rome. In the latter town he found some difficulty in
obtaining access to the library and archives of the Vatican.
Count Rudolph L&uuml;tzow, then Austrian ambassador
at Rome, who was himself a Bohemian, and to
whom Palack&yacute; had been recommended, succeeded, however,
in obtaining for him permission to examine at least
some of the MSS. which he wished to see. Palack&yacute; has
himself left us an interesting account<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> of the difficulties
he encountered on the part of Monsignor Marini, prefect
of the Vatican archives. They were caused, it was stated,
principally by alleged indiscretions committed by Ranke,
who some time previously had been allowed to study the
archives of the Vatican.</p>

<p>After Palack&yacute;'s return to Bohemia, the task of continuing
his great historical work absorbed him so completely
that he ceased to edit the Journal. His quiet and
studious life was, like that of other Bohemian scholars,
interrupted by the revolutionary events of the year 1848.
The movement in favour of the revival of Bohemian
nationality had hitherto been an entirely literary one,
and the Bohemians very naturally chose their most prominent
writers as their political leaders. As Bohemia,
with many other non-German parts of Austria, then
formed part of the Germanic Confederation, prominent
Bohemians, and among them Palack&yacute;, were invited to
take part in the proceedings of the German National
Assembly that met at Frankfort in 1848. Palack&yacute;'s
reply, which caused great sensation at the time, is still
worth quoting, as it became the watchword of the Bohemian
patriots. He wrote: "I am not a German, but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>Bohemian. Whatever talent I possess is at the service
of my own country. My nation is certainly a small one,
but it has always maintained its historical individuality.
The rulers of Bohemia have often been on terms of
intimacy with the German princes, but the Bohemian
people has never considered itself as German." It is a
proof of the rapidity with which Palack&yacute; acquired consideration,
that one of the short-lived Austrian cabinets
of 1848 (that of Pillersdorf), wishing to obtain the support
of the Bohemian nation, offered him the post of
Minister of Public Instruction. Though his national
theories prevented Palack&yacute; from taking part in the deliberations
of the German National Assembly, he was a
member of the Slav Congress at Prague and of the
Austrian Parliament which in 1848 and 1849 met first at
Vienna, then at Kremsier.</p>

<p>The short period of liberal government in Austria
ended with the year 1849. Palack&yacute; suffered, like all the
Bohemian patriots, from the German and absolutist rule,
which was re-established in Bohemia in a more aggravated
manner than before.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> A paper to which Palack&yacute;
contributed was suppressed because of an article from
his pen which had caused sensation, and the military
authorities deliberated whether the writer should be
tried by court-martial.</p>

<p>In 1861, when a new attempt to establish constitutional
government in Austria was made, Palack&yacute; was
made a life-member of the Upper Chamber of the Parliament
of Vienna. He only spoke there twice, in August
and September of the year that he had been named.
The question of an agreement with Hungary was then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>under discussion. Hungary claimed almost complete
independence, and Palack&yacute; rightly maintained that the
establishing new small states was contrary to the tendency
to union that then prevailed in Europe. Palack&yacute;
advised the Hungarians, as well as the Bohemians, to
make considerable concessions to the Central Government
of Vienna. He seems already to have foreseen,
what actually occurred six years later, that Hungary
would be granted almost complete independence, and
Bohemia considered a mere Austrian province.</p>

<p>Though Palack&yacute;, always favourable to the preservation
of the Austrian empire, was prepared to concede to the
Central Government in Vienna far more extensive powers
than the Hungarians were, he yet claimed for Bohemia
and the Parliament of Prague a very extensive autonomy,
on lines similar, though not identical, with those of the
ancient Bohemian constitution, which perished on the
day of the battle of the White Mountain. When Palack&yacute;
found that the Parliament of Vienna was discussing
matters that he considered beyond its competency, and
encroaching on the rights of the Bohemian representative
body, he left Vienna on September 30, 1861,
and never again took his seat in the Austrian Upper
House. Of the Bohemian Parliament Palack&yacute; was a
member from the time that it first met in 1861. He
attended its meetings whenever the National or Bohemian
party took part in its deliberations, which they,
from political reasons, often refused to do. From 1861
to his death in 1876, Palack&yacute; was the recognised leader
of the National party in Bohemia. A detailed account
of his life during that time would be a record of the
political struggles of Bohemia during those years, and
would be out of place here. The admiration and venera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>tion
of the Bohemians for the "Otec Vlast&iacute;" (Father
of the Country), as he was called, increased with his
increasing years. On April 23, 1876, the completion of
Palack&yacute;'s great historical work was celebrated by a
banquet at Prague, at which the historian was present.
He seems to have felt the presentiment of approaching
death, and indeed described the speech which he
delivered as his testament. The speech is so characteristic
of Palack&yacute; that I shall quote a few words from it.
"Our nation," he said, "is in great danger, surrounded,
as it is, by enemies in every direction; but I do not
despair; I hope that it will be able to vanquish them, if
it has but the will to do so. It is not enough to say
'I will'; every one must co-operate, must work, must
make what sacrifices he can for the common welfare,
particularly for the preservation of our nationality. The
Bohemian nation has a brilliant past record. The time
of Hus was a glorious time. The Bohemian people then
surpassed in intellectual culture all other nations of
Europe.... It is now necessary that we should educate
ourselves and work in accordance with the demands of
culture and intellect. This is the only testament that,
speaking almost as a dying man, I wish to leave to my
people." Palack&yacute;'s presentiment proved but too true.
He died, after a very short illness, on May 26, 1876.
His funeral was the occasion of general national mourning
in Bohemia.</p>

<p>Though, as already mentioned, the study of history
from his early youth appealed particularly to Palack&yacute;,
it was by a work of a very different character that he
first became known to the small group of men who in
the earlier half of the present century were interested
in Bohemian literature. While still studying at Press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>burg,
Palack&yacute; published a translation of some of the
poems of Ossian, which was enthusiastically welcomed
by his friends.</p>

<p>It was at Prague only that he decided on writing his
<i>History of Bohemia</i>, which made him the foremost man
of his nation, and which he has himself described as
"especially the work of my whole life." Palack&yacute;'s preliminary
labours in the archives of his own country and
then in those of Germany and Italy have already been
noticed. Of the immense difficulties which Palack&yacute;'s
historical work encountered he has himself given an
interesting account. All printed writings were then in
Austria and Bohemia under the control of the "censure-office,"
to which I have already referred. The Government,
there is no doubt, was in principle opposed to
the publication of a history of Bohemia founded on
the best available documents, that is to say, of a work
really deserving the name of a history. They were too
ignorant to know to how great an extent such a work
would contradict the short accounts of the past of
Bohemia&mdash;written with a strongly Romanist and anti-Bohemian
tendency, and founded on Hajek's chronicle&mdash;that
were then in general use; but they somehow
felt that this would be the case. "The Austrian Government
was convinced," Palack&yacute; writes, "that its past
conduct as regards Bohemia would not obtain praise
from the tribunal of history. What occurred during
the Thirty Years' War and since that period in the interior
of Bohemia is still one of history's secrets; it makes the
few who have attempted slightly to lift the veil under
which these events are hidden shudder."</p>

<p>In 1836 the first volume of Palack&yacute;'s <i>History of Bohemia</i>
appeared. It was published in German, as were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
the volumes that were issued up to the year 1848. Henceforth
the book appeared simultaneously in German and
Bohemian. When Palack&yacute;, towards the end of his life,
re-wrote his great work, the earlier parts also appeared in
Bohemian. The first volume, dealing with a period when
the history of Bohemia is more than half mythical, was
treated very leniently by the censors, who considered the
fables of Pr&#283;mysl and Libussa very harmless. In the
Austria of the earlier part of this century the words
"Securus licet &AElig;naeam Rutulumque ferocem committas ..." were as true as in the Rome of the emperors.</p>

<p>Difficulties, however, began when Palack&yacute; had reached
the period of Hus. The masterly account of the life and
death of the great Bohemian, no doubt the most brilliant
part of Palack&yacute;'s work, greatly displeased the censors
to whom it was submitted. The ecclesiastical censor
suggested a very plain course, namely, that Palack&yacute;'s
work should be entirely suppressed. Prince Metternich,
who was consulted, proposed that Palack&yacute; should omit
all "objectionable reasoning," but should be allowed to
state facts.</p>

<p>The correspondence between Palack&yacute; and the censors&mdash;published
by the former after the suppression of that
detestable institution&mdash;is irresistibly comic. The censors
had not only, as is generally supposed, the power of
striking out passages in an author's work that displeased
them, they were also entitled to insert passages in a
book that were often in direct contradiction with the
writer's views. Palack&yacute;'s description of the corruption
of the Roman clergy in the fifteenth century was suppressed,
and he was ordered to attribute the rise of the
Hussite movement to the "stubbornness, inflexible obstinacy,
and dogmaticalness" of Hus. Palack&yacute; patiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
consented, but he ventured to remonstrate when objections
were raised against his account of the courageous
demeanour of Hus when before the Council. He was
instructed to state that Hus had "appeared irresolute"
when brought before his judges. Palack&yacute; remarked
that this statement would be in contradiction with the
passage quoted above which he had been ordered to
insert The ignorance of the censor is proved by the
fact that when Palack&yacute; quoted Poggio Bracciolini's account
of the death of Jerome of Prague, he was unaware
of the existence of the well-known Italian humanist,
and requested to be informed who he was. He also
expressed doubts as to the authenticity of the letter to
Lionardo Aretino in which that account is contained,
though it had then already been frequently printed, and
is quoted by numerous Protestant and Catholic writers,
including Pope Pius II, Palack&yacute; lived to see the abolition
of censure, and to republish in their original form
the volumes of his History that he had been obliged to
submit to it.</p>

<p>Political events and the ever-increasing mass of materials,
which of course proportionately increased Palack&yacute;'s
labours, delayed the progress of the History, and it was
only in 1867 that the second part of the fifth volume,
which reaches to the accession of the House of Habsburg
to the Bohemian throne in 1526, was published. Bohemian
historians generally end their work with the battle
of the White Mountain in 1620, and this was no doubt
Palack&yacute;'s intention. His remark, quoted above, proves
that he never intended to write the history of Bohemia
during and after the Thirty Years' War. In 1861 he
had, however, already formed the decision to end his
narrative with the year 1526, and he informed the Estates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
of Bohemia&mdash;who contributed to the expenses of the
publication&mdash;of that intention.</p>

<p>During the last nine years of his life Palack&yacute; employed
whatever spare time his political engagements left him
in re-writing parts of his History in accordance with fresh
materials, in completing the Bohemian version of parts
that had at first appeared in German only, and in eliminating
the passages that the censors had obliged him to
insert. This new revised edition was, as already mentioned,
completed only in the year of the author's death.</p>

<p>Palack&yacute;'s <i>History of Bohemia</i> is now recognised as one
of the great historical works of the nineteenth century.
Though less known in England than on the Continent,
it has there also obtained the praises of historians, such
as Bishop Creighton and the late Mr. Wratislaw. It is
not easy to define the circumstances that rendered the
publication of Palack&yacute;'s monumental work a political
event in Bohemia, contributing greatly to the revival of
national feeling. The record of a glorious past came as
a revelation to the Bohemians, whom the German inhabitants
of Austria were, in consequence of their long
supremacy, in the habit of treating with contempt. It
fortified the patriots in their belief that their nation and
its language would not perish. It is this conviction
which alone explains the intense veneration for Palack&yacute;
which all Bohemians felt, many of whom had neither
the money to buy nor the time to read his great historical
work. The recently published centenary memorial
of Palack&yacute; contains many striking instances of the devotion
with which Bohemians of all classes regarded the
historian of their country. I may be permitted to quote
one anecdote from the Memorial. A young tailor's apprentice
from Moravia, named Breynek, during a visit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
Prague, met Palack&yacute; in the street. Innumerable photographs
of the great historian had rendered Breynek
familiar with his features. He walked up to him, stating
that he was a Moravian and a countryman. Palack&yacute;
conversed affably with him for several minutes and then
gave him his hand. This meeting became the principal
event of Breynek's life. Every date was designated as
having happened "before I met Palack&yacute;" or "after I
met Palack&yacute;." He only regretted that he had been too
shy "to kiss the hand that had written the history of his
country." Palack&yacute;'s History, as already noted, was published
simultaneously in German and in Bohemian; the
earliest volumes indeed at first appeared in the former
language only. The book is therefore not so inaccessible
as the works of the earlier Bohemian historians, from
which I have given copious quotations. An English
translation of Palack&yacute;'s history of Bohemia is, however,
still a desideratum.</p>

<p>With the exception of a short German biography of
Dobrovsk&yacute;, most of Palack&yacute;'s minor works are connected
with his great History; some are the results of studies
preparatory to the great work; others contain documentary
evidence in support of statements made in the book;
in others again, Palack&yacute; enters into controversies with
some of the critics of his work. I shall mention some of
the most important of these works. In the year 1829 the
Bohemian Society of Sciences offered a prize for the best
essay on the early historians of Bohemia. Palack&yacute; won
this prize with his first historical work, entitled <i>W&uuml;rdigung</i>
<i>der alten B&ouml;hmischen Geschichtschreiber</i>. The book
was written in German, and was first published in the
Journal of the Bohemian Museum, that then appeared
in German as well as in Bohemian. In 1830 it was re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>published
separately in an enlarged form. The book
gives short and concise sketches of the lives of the Bohemian
historians from Cosmas to Hajek. It is still of
value, and indispensable to all who study the works of
these historians. Like this book, closely connected with
Palack&yacute;'s principal work, is a short historical sketch
entitled <i>Die Vorl&auml;ufer des Hussitanthums</i> ("The Precursors
of Hussitism"). The fate of this little book is rather
curious. In 1842 Palack&yacute; read a paper on "The Precursors
of Hus" before the Bohemian Society of
Sciences. Wishing to publish its contents, he, as in duty
bound, submitted the MS. to the censure-office. The
officials there, however, entirely declined to give their
consent to the publication of the book. A copy of the
MS. came into the hands of Dr. Jordan of Leipzig, who
in 1846 published it there under his own name. This was
done with the consent of Palack&yacute;, who was more desirous
that the fruits of his research should become public than
that he should obtain personal recognition. The book
has since been reprinted under the name of the real
author, and still has great value. I have availed myself
of its contents when writing of the precursors of Hus In
chapter ii. of this book.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, if we consider the previous general
ignorance on the subject of Bohemian history, that from
the moment his book began to appear Palack&yacute; became
the object of violent attacks. The first attacks proceeded
from German writers, but after the publication of the
volume that deals with Hus, other Catholic writers also
joined in these attacks. The treatment which the Slavs
of Northern Germany, and sometimes those of Bohemia
also have endured on the part of the Germans, could
only be defended by describing these tribes as brutal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
savage, and cruel barbarians. Palack&yacute; has certainly
proved that these descriptions, founded on vague statements
of German monks or on the mendacious Hajek,
are at least grossly exaggerated. Palack&yacute;'s impartial
account of the career of Hus, who had in Austria previously
been described in accordance with the words of
the censor, which I have quoted, displeased the more
prejudiced Roman Catholics, Professor H&ouml;fler, who
was both a fanatical Teuton and a bigoted Roman
Catholic, was the most persistent opponent of Palack&yacute;.
Palack&yacute; replied to his criticism in his <i>Geschichte des Hussitanthums</i>
<i>und Professor H&ouml;fler</i> which appeared in 1868.
Mainly polemical also was Palack&yacute;'s small work, <i>Zur</i>
<i>B&ouml;hmischen Geschichtschreibung</i>, published in 1871. In
this book the author defends his historical work against
the attacks of Professor H&ouml;fler and other German critics.
He gives here also an account of his old controversies
with the censure-office, from which I have quoted.</p>

<p>Several collections of documents are also due to the
diligence of Palack&yacute;. In 1860 he published a collection
of&mdash;mostly Latin&mdash;documents referring to the reign of
King George of Pod&#283;brad. A similar but far more interesting
collection of Latin and Bohemian documents was
published in 1869. I have in chapter iii. frequently quoted
this collection, on which, indeed, my account of the
career of Hus is principally based. The Latin documents
are printed in that language only, but Palack&yacute; has given
a Latin translation of those that were written in Bohemian.
An additional collection of documents, published
in 1873, refers to the period of the Hussite wars. In the
last years of his life Palack&yacute; published in three volumes
a selection of the most important historical, political, and
literary essays which he had written in Bohemian. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
is by no means a complete list of Palack&yacute;'s works. In
the "question of the MS." he, as already mentioned,
figured as a defender of the authenticity of these documents.</p>

<p>It is to the four writers whom I have now successively
referred to that the revival of the Bohemian language
and of Bohemian literature is principally due. They
were the centre of a group of writers who, if less talented,
were no less patriotic and enthusiastic. The isolated
position in which they were at first placed, surrounded
by Germans or Germanised Bohemians, and living under
an absolute Government, that always treated them with
suspicion and often with positive enmity, caused these
men to draw closely together; many of them were
indeed on terms of intimate friendship. The vast
amount of correspondence that passed between them, to
which I have already referred, is now gradually being
published. It is characteristic of these writers that they
rarely limited their labours to one subject, but generally
wrote both in poetry and in prose, and on the most
varied subjects. Their patriotic motive was the wish to
prove that the new, or rather revived, literature possessed
works on all subjects and in every literary form. That
this sometimes led to superficiality and mediocrity cannot
be denied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wenceslas Hanka</span> (1791-1861) has already been
mentioned in these pages as the discoverer of the MS.
of K&ouml;niginhof, and it is as such that he is principally
known. He is, however, the author of a collection of
Bohemian songs that soon became very popular, and
of several works on Bohemian grammar and etymology.
He also published numerous translations from the German
and from the Slav languages, and edited Hus's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
<i>Deerka</i> and <i>Dalimil's Chronicle</i>, which were then almost
unknown.</p>

<p>A better poet than Hanka was his contemporary Ladislav
&#268;elakovsk&yacute;. The best of his many poetical works
are two collections of national songs entitled respectively
<i>Echoes of Russian Song</i> and <i>Echoes of Bohemian Song</i>.
These books, contrary to what the title would lead one to
infer, are mainly original, though &#268;elakovsk&yacute; has made
thorough use of his knowledge of the legends and
traditions of the Slav peasantry. Another collection
of poetry is entitled <i>The Hundred-Leaved Rose</i>. As in
Kollar's <i>Daughter of Sl&aacute;va</i>, the love motive struggles with
the patriotic motive for supremacy in this poem&mdash;not
perhaps to its advantage. We possess prose works also
of &#268;elakovsk&yacute; dealing with the Bohemian language.
That subject was ever before the minds of the Bohemian
writers of the earlier half of this century, of whom
&#268;elakovsk&yacute; is one of the most correct.</p>

<p>It is beyond the purpose of this book to give a complete
list of the modern "minor poets" of Bohemia.
I may mention as among the best, Macha, who imitated
Byron, Jungmann's friend Marek, Halek, Koubek, and
Rubes. The last-named is the author of a song entitled
<i>Ja jsem &#268;ech a kdo je vic?</i> ("I am a Bohemian,
and who is more?"), which is still very popular in Bohemia.
The drama has only been greatly cultivated in
Bohemia within the last twenty years, particularly since
the establishment of the large Bohemian theatre at
Prague. At present Bohemia possesses a considerable
number of dramatic authors. Of older dramatists we
must first mention Joseph Tyl (1808-1856), the author
of very numerous dramatic works. In one of these
Tyl introduced a song beginning with the words <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span><i>Kde</i>
<i>je domov muj?</i> ("Where is my home?"). This song
rapidly became very popular, and can now almost be
considered as the national air of Bohemia. Wenceslas
Klicpera (1792-1859) wrote over fifty comedies and
tragedies, and, though none of his plays are above
mediocrity, contributed considerably to the development
of the Bohemian stage, which then possessed
hardly any dramatic works. Of novelists belonging
to the early period of the revival of Bohemian literature,
we should mention Mrs. Bo&#382;ena N&#283;mcova, who
was born in 1820 and died in 1862. Her novels,
which deal mainly with the simple life of the Bohemian
villagers, have obtained a well-deserved popularity.
Mrs. N&#283;mcova's masterpiece, the <i>Babi&#269;ka</i> ("Grandmother"),
has been translated into English, French,
Russian, German, and many other languages. A very
talented writer of historical novels was Wenceslas
Bene&#353; T&#345;ebizky (1849-1884).</p>

<p>Two gifted sisters, whose work was of great assistance
to the development of Bohemian literature, also deserve
mention. I refer to the sisters Rott, who belong to
a period somewhat later than Mrs. N&#283;mcova. The
elder sister assumed the pseudonym of Karolina Sv&#283;tla
(1830-1893), and is the author of many interesting
novels, of which <i>Kri&#382; u potoka</i> ("The Cross by the
Stream") obtained the greatest success. Sophia Rott&mdash;afterwards
Mrs. Podlipsk&aacute;&mdash;(1833-1897) produced a
cycle of historical novels that have great interest, though
they are not devoid of anachronisms.</p>

<p>Of writers on scientific subjects, one of the earliest
was John Presl (1791-1849). Presl was Professor of
Natural History at the University of Prague, and the
first modern Bohemian works on this subject are due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
to him. The patriots, as already mentioned, wished to
prove that all subjects could be treated in the national
language. Presl is the originator of the present system
of Bohemian phraseology as regards the subjects on
which he wrote, and he has therefore well deserved
the gratitude of the Bohemian people. It is of him
and of Marek that the story is told that, when they
were visiting Jungmann to discuss the future of
Bohemian literature, the latter remarked to his visitors:
"It needs only that the ceiling of this room should fall
in, and there will be an end of Bohemian literature!"</p>

<p>Great also are the services to the Bohemian cause of
Charles Jaromir Erben; born in 1811, he died in 1870
as archivist of the town of Prague. Erben's works, like
those of many Bohemian writers of his time, deal with
various subjects. It is really only the establishment of
the national university which has made it possible for
us to have specialists in all branches of science at the
present day. Erben published several collections of
Bohemian popular poetry and various interesting works
on the folklore of his country. We have to thank him
also for an edition of selected works of Ilus, which has
value until the definitive edition of the works of the
Bohemian martyr is completed. The works of Hus,
particularly those written in the Bohemian language,
were formerly almost inaccessible. Erben also edited
&#352;titn&yacute;'s books on <i>General Christian Matters</i>, Harant of
Pol&#382;ic's Travels, the Chronicles of Barto&#353;, the writer,
and many minor works. These editions have valuable
notes and biographies of the ancient writers, which I
have frequently used in the earlier parts of this work.</p>

<p>More limited was the range of studies of Dr. Joseph
Jire&#269;ek (1825-1888). His works mostly deal with Slavic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
particularly with Bohemian literature. Jire&#269;ek's <i>Rukov&#283;t</i>,
or <i>Handbook of the History of Bohemian Literature</i>, is
still one of the best books dealing with the subject.
That part of the work which refers to the writers of
the so-called "unity", founded on entirely new documents,
will not be superseded for a considerable time.
Dr. Jire&#269;ek played a considerable part in Bohemian
and Austrian politics, and was, as Minister of Public
Instruction, a member of Count Hohenwarth's short-lived
Cabinet (1870-1871).</p>

<p>One of the results of the revolutionary movement
of 1848 was the rapid development of journalism in
Bohemia. Its originator was Charles Havli&#269;ek (1820-1856).
Endowed with an exceptional talent for satire,
he strongly attacked the unpopular Austrian rule in
Bohemia. He collected many of his political articles
in the famed <i>Kutnohorsk&iacute; Epi&#353;toly</i> ("Letters from Kutna
Hora"). Of his satirical works, <i>K&#345;est' Svat&eacute;ho Vladimira</i>
("The Baptism of St. Vladimir") is the most witty.
During the time of reaction that followed the revolutionary
years 1848 and 1849, Havli&#269;ek was exiled to
Brixen in the Tirol by the Austrian Government. We
owe to this exile his <i>Tyrolsk&eacute; Elegie</i> ("Tirolese Elegies"),
one of his finest works. Havli&#269;ek was allowed to return
to his country shortly before his death.</p>

<p>As a result of the brilliant example given by Palack&yacute;,
great attention has recently been devoted to the long-neglected
annals of Bohemian history. Dealing now
only with those who are deceased, I will first mention
Dr. Anton Gindely (1829-1888), whose studies were
mainly devoted to the history of Bohemia in the early
part of the seventeenth century. He did not live to complete
his great work, a history of the Thirty Years' War,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
but his minor studies have thrown considerable light on
little-known subjects connected with Bohemian history.
Thus the great influence of Christian of Anhalt on Bohemian
politics can be considered as almost a discovery
of Gindely's. It may be said that Gindely's speciality was
his liking for the study of original sources (the "Quellenstudium,"
as it is called by the Germans), and there may
have been some exaggeration in his method.</p>

<p>Professor Karel Tieftrunk's (1829-1897) studies of
Bohemian history deal with a rather earlier period
than that chosen by Dr. Gindely. His principal work,
<i>Odpor stavuv c&#283;sk&yacute;ch proti Ferdinandovi I.</i> ("The Opposition
of the Bohemian Estates to Ferdinand I."), is
very valuable, and is founded on the contemporary
record of Sixt of Ottersdorf, as well as on careful
archival study.</p>

<p>Professor Wenceslas Tomek (1818-1905), during his
long life of study, enriched Bohemian literature with
numerous and valuable historical works, and he held
up to his death the rank of the most prominent historian
of his country. In the last years of his life he published
his memoirs, which are somewhat disappointing. The
extreme caution which was innate in an Austrian subject
of Tomek's generation, and perhaps also the
staunchly conservative views which he held after
youthful radicalism had left him, induced him to
avoid, with perhaps exaggerated caution, all mention
of matters that might give offence to the governing
powers. Wenceslas Tomek was born at Kr&aacute;lov&eacute; Hradec
(K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz) in 1818. His father, as he tells us, was a
shoemaker, who had some time previously established
himself in that town. Though Tomek for a time studied
law, he soon devoted himself entirely to historical work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
Even in his younger and more liberal days he appears
to have been a fervent adherent of the Church of Rome;
but he tells us in his memoirs that he was severely
reprimanded by the then formidable "censure"-office
for having stated in one of his earliest writings that
Socrates&mdash;a pagan!&mdash;had been an honest man. The
greatest work of Tomek, his <i>D&#283;jepis m&#283;sta Prahy</i>
("History of the Town of Prague"), perhaps one of
the greatest town-histories of the nineteenth century,
which he only began late in life, remained
unfinished. It is of priceless value because of the
treasures of research that it contains, and is as valuable
to those who frequently differ from Professor
Tomek's views as to those who are always in sympathy
with his opinions. A history of the University
of Prague by Tomek also remained unfinished, and it
may be considered as having been superseded by Dr.
Winter's more recent works. Tomek is also the author
of a biography of John Z&#464;&#382;ka, which&mdash;as indeed do
all Tomek's works&mdash;gives evidence of deep and conscientious
research. That the author is not in sympathy
with the hero of his biography is a fact which, though
it does not diminish the historical value of the book,
undoubtedly detracts from its artistic worth. Z&#464;&#382;ka's
biography remains unwritten, and the strange, totally
uncritical, and fantastic <i>Jean Z&#464;&#382;ka</i> of George Sand is
perhaps none the less a truer portrait of the great
Bohemian hero than Professor Tomek's book. The
other works of Tomek on Austrian and Bohemian
history are little more than school-books.</p>

<p>Two writers who died recently, and whose influence
on the Bohemian literature of the present day is great,
are Neruda and Zeyer. As is frequently the case with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
Bohemian writers, these authors cultivated several
branches of literature. Jon Neruda was born in the
Prague Mal&aacute; Strana (the part of the city which is
situated on the left bank of the Vltava river) in 1834.
His books, both in prose and in verse, are very
numerous. Of his poems, the <i>P&iacute;sn&#283; Kosmick&eacute;</i> ("Cosmic
Poems"), which are the result of deep philosophic
thought, had a great success when they appeared in
1878. Some critics, however, assert that the book is
somewhat obscure. Of Neruda's many prose works,
some of which first appeared as <i>feuilletons</i> in the
<i>Narodni Listz</i>, the foremost Bohemian newspaper, the
best are the <i>Malostransk&eacute; pov&iacute;dky</i> ("Tales of the Mal&aacute;
Strana"). Neruda died in 1891.</p>

<p>Julius Zeyer (1841-1901) was certainly one of the
most prominent writers of the period of the literary
revival in Bohemia. Though he did not begin writing
in early life, he was, like most of the writers of his
time, the author of numerous works both in prose
and in verse. His first book, <i>Ondry Cerny&#353;ev</i>, a historical
novel, the scene of which is laid in Russia at
the time of the Empress Catherine II., appeared in
1875. Zeyer lived a considerable time in Russia, and
also frequently visited Italy. Next to his own Bohemia,
these two countries influenced him most. In perhaps
the best of his many novels, <i>Jan Maria Ployhar</i>, the
scene is laid in Italy. Of Zeyer's poetical works, the
best is his <i>Vy&#353;ehrad</i>, a cycle of epic poems which
deal with the legendary period of Libusa and Premysl.
It is undoubtedly one of the most valuable fruits
of modern Bohemian poetry.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Zeyer also attempted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>though not very successfully, to write for the stage
and he is also the author of a biography of the
Bohemian patriot, Vojta Naprstek, with whom and
with whose family he was on terms of friendship.</p>

<p>The last twenty years have contributed in a quite
unprecedented manner to the development of the
Bohemian language and literature. The Bohemian
writers now living have added greatly to the fame of
their country, and have brought the national language
to a degree of purity and polish which it had never
attained before. Many circumstances have contributed
to this result. The foundation of the Bohemian
Academy of Francis Joseph, which added to the
Society of Sciences and that of the Museum a third
learned society, has been very helpful. The foundation
of a large national theatre has greatly encouraged
dramatic authors, and the fact that the national language
has to a very great extent among the middle
classes, and to a lesser degree among the upper ones
also, taken the place of German, has been of immense
value to the Bohemian novelists. Those of the present
day have naturally a great superiority over their predecessors,
who, when attempting to describe Bohemian
society, wrote of counts and barons, while the counts
and barons of that period in real life only spoke
German.</p>

<p>The living Bohemian writers are so numerous that
I have, though reluctantly, omitted the names of many
whose works are of value. The study of history continues
in Bohemia without interruption, as is indeed
natural in a country where the records of a splendid
past afford some solace to those who feel that their
country plays but a subordinate part in the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
Austro-Hungarian empire. Of the living historians of
Bohemia, one of the most prominent is Professor
Joseph Kalousek, born at Vamberk in 1838. He
showed from early youth great talent for historical
research; and his writings include, besides larger
works, a vast number of articles that have appeared
in the various Bohemian reviews and magazines. One
of the most important works of the learned professor
is his <i>Statni Pravo</i>, a study of the ancient constitution
of Bohemia. The book first appeared in 1871 at the
moment when an imperial decree had assured the
Bohemians that the constitution would be restored to
them. Other works of Professor Kalousek are a treatise
on the use of the chalice in Bohemia in the period
previous to Hus&mdash;a matter the importance of which
only those thoroughly acquainted with Bohemian history
can gauge&mdash;and a recent book entitled <i>Obrana</i>
<i>Kni&#382;ete V&aacute;clava Svat&eacute;ho</i> ("A Defence of Prince Wenceslas
the Holy"). Dr. Kalousek, a firm adherent of
the Church of Rome, here upholds the memory of St.
Wenceslas, who has been treated rather unfavourably
by Palack&yacute; and other Bohemian historians. Kalousek
has also shown great interest in the history of the
Bohemian peasantry during the period of serfdom.
Many of the documents referring to this subject, published
by him in the <i>Archiv &#268;esky</i>, which he edits, are
of great value.</p>

<p>Among the historians of the present day I should
next mention Dr. Jaroslav Goll (born 1846). Professor
Goll is one of the shining lights of the new Bohemian
University, and his historical works are very valuable.
Dr. Goll studied for a time at the German University
of G&ouml;ttingen, which was then, in consequence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
presence of the great historian Waitz, a centre of
historical study in Germany. Somewhat later Goll for
a short time acted as secretary to the historian Bancroft,
then Minister of the United States in Berlin. These
and other visits to foreign countries enabled Goll to
acquire a thorough acquaintance with foreign languages.
He has proved his knowledge of French by the translation
of the <i>Fleurs du mal</i> of Baudelaire, which he
published jointly with the poet Vrchlick&yacute;. Goll subsequently
devoted himself entirely to historical research.
His studies, dealing with the formerly little-known
community of the Bohemian brethren, which appeared
both as separate works and in the columns of the
<i>&#268;asopis Musea &#268;esk&eacute;ho</i> ("Journal of the Bohemian
Museum"), are of great importance to the history of
Bohemia. Of great and fascinating interest also is
Dr. Goll's <i>&#268;echy a Prusy</i>, a work which deals with the
little-known relations between Bohemia and Prussia
in the Middle Ages. Together with Professor Pek&aacute;&#345;&mdash;also
a distinguished historian&mdash;Professor Goll edits the
<i>&#268;esky &#268;asopis historick&yacute;</i>, a review whose purpose is
similar to that of the English historical review.</p>

<p>Dr. Anton Rezek (born 1853) is one of the prominent
historians of Bohemia, though political duties&mdash;he was
for some time a member of the Austrian Cabinet&mdash;and
latterly ill-health, have somewhat interfered with his
historical studies. His works deal mainly with the
history of Bohemia during the earlier part of the sixteenth
century&mdash;a momentous period; for it was then,
in 1526, that the permanent rule of the house of Habsburg
over Bohemia began. Many of Rezek's works
have been published in the <i>&#268;asopis Musea &#268;esk&eacute;ho</i>, and
some have appeared in German also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Joseph Truhl&aacute;&#345; has devoted himself successfully
to the interesting subject of humanism in Bohemia.
The humanist movement, suspected both as coming
from Rome and as having what were believed to be
pagan tendencies, reached Bohemia late. Its principal
adherent in that country was Bohuslav of Lobkovic,
whose letters Dr. Truhl&aacute;&#345; has edited and published.
He is also the author of the interesting work entitled
<i>Humanismus a Humaniste v &#268;echach za Kr&aacute;le Vladislava</i>
<i>II.</i></p>

<p>Professor Sigismund Winter (born 1846) is the author
of interesting works dealing with the internal condition
of Bohemia in ancient times. His history of the
University of Prague, his <i>&#381;ivot cirkevni</i>, a study of
the ecclesiastical condition of Bohemia in the Hussite
period, and indeed all his writings, are indispensable
to the student of Bohemian history.</p>

<p>Of younger Bohemian historians Dr. Wenceslas
Flaj&#353;hans deserves mention. He has devoted much
time and talent to the study of the life and works of
Hus, of whom he has recently written an excellent
biography. Dr. Flaj&#353;hans is also the author of a
history of Bohemian literature, to which I here gratefully
acknowledge my indebtedness. Mr. Jaroslav Vl&#269;ek,
who, together with Mr. Hlad&iacute;k, edits the review <i>Lumir</i>,
has also begun a history of Bohemian literature that
is of great interest.</p>

<p>The study of philology has recently been greatly
developed in Bohemia. One of the greatest living
Bohemian philologists is Professor Gebauer, to whose
writings it is principally due that the genuineness of
the MSS. of Zelen&aacute; Hora and Kr&aacute;lov&eacute; Dvur is now
generally considered doubtful. Professor Gebauer has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
now begun the publication of a historical grammar of
the Bohemian language on a large scale. Only Part I.
and Part III. (consisting of two volumes) have as yet
appeared. Another of the principal opponents of the
genuineness of the MSS. was Professor Tomas Masaryk
(born 1850). Besides being a philologist, Dr. Masaryk
is also a distinguished writer on philosophical subjects.</p>

<p>Of great value to Bohemian philology and early
literature are the labours of Mr. Adolphus Patera,
formerly head librarian of the Bohemian Museum at
Prague. For many years Mr. Patera has employed
his annual holidays in searching for early Bohemian
MSS., many of which, though forgotten, still exist in
the libraries of the towns and monasteries of Bohemia
and Moravia. Mr. Patera has been indefatigable in
deciphering these very ancient MSS., and has published
the results of his work in the <i>&#268;asopsis Musea Kr&aacute;lovstv&iacute;</i>
<i>&#268;esk&eacute;ho</i>. The very interesting but long-neglected study
of Bohemian folklore has been greatly assisted by the
labours of Mr. Patera's successor, Dr. Zibrt, librarian of
the Bohemian Museum. He has published many of the
results of his researches in the periodical <i>&#268;esky Lid</i> ("The
Bohemian People"). To render his studies accessible
to a larger number of readers, Dr. Zibrt very wisely
publishes a French edition of his periodical. Professor
Mourek, who has mainly studied philological subjects,
has enriched the literature of his country by very valuable
Bohemian-English and Anglo-Bohemian dictionaries.
The learned professor is a thorough master of the
English language. Dr. Jaromir &#268;elakovsk&yacute; (born 1846),
up to recently archivist of the city of Prague, a son of
the poet &#268;elakovsk&yacute;, is the author of many valuable
studies concerning the ancient judicial and constitu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>tional
institutions of Bohemia. Dr. Augustine Sedl&aacute;&#269;ek
(born 1843) is the author of a monumental illustrated
work entitled <i>Hrady a z&aacute;mky &#269;esk&eacute;</i> ("Strongholds and
Castles of Bohemia"), of which thirteen volumes have
already appeared, and which is invaluable for the
student of Bohemian history and archaeology. The
prehistoric antiquity of Bohemia has recently been
the subject of erudite works by Dr. P&iacute;&#269; (<i>Staro&#382;itnost</i>
<i>zem&#283; &#269;esk&eacute;</i>, "The Antiquities of the Bohemian Land")
and Dr. Niederle (<i>Staro&#382;itnosti &#269;esk&eacute;</i>, "The Antiquities
of Bohemia").</p>

<p>Novelists are at present very numerous in Bohemia
and, as already mentioned, the extension of the national
language enables the authors of the present day to write
in a fashion more lifelike than was that of their predecessors.
Of the older novelists I will first mention
Wenceslas Vl&#269;ek (born 1839). Of his numerous novels
<i>V&#283;nce vavrinovy</i> ("The Wreath of Laurels") is, I think
rightly, considered the best. Jacob Arbes (born 1840)
is, like most Bohemian authors, a very fruitful writer.
Of his many works his <i>Romanetta</i>, a collection of short
and very striking tales, is perhaps the best. Alois
Jirasek (born 1851) has, like so many Bohemian writers
devoted himself to historical romances, which have a
natural fascination for the inhabitants of a country
with a great past. In justice to Mr. Jirasek it should
be stated that in contrast from minor writers he has
succeeded in portraying in a masterly manner the
period of Hus and the Taborites. Of his historical
novels, the scene of which is laid in this period, I may
mention the three volumes which Jirasek has named
<i>Mezi proudy</i> ("In the Midst of the Stream"), and the
book entitled <i>Proti Vsem</i> ("Against All"), a "Page<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
from the Bohemian Epic". A novel entitled <i>Psohlavci</i>,
which treats of a later period, that in which,
after the battle of the White Mountain, the Bohemian
peasants were deprived of their last vestiges of liberty,
is among Jirasek's most popular works. Jirasek has
also appeared before the public as a dramatist, and
his powerful tragedy, <i>Jan Z&#464;&#382;ka</i>, which has been often
and brilliantly produced at the National Theatre of
Prague, appeals to me more than any of his historical
novels. The last scene of the fourth act, in which
Z&#464;&#382;ka addresses the faithless city of Prague, has an
almost unrivalled beauty. William Mr&#353;tik is the author
of several clever novels. Of younger writers, Wenceslas
Hlad&iacute;k (born 1868) deserves mention. He is the author
of a considerable number of novels and dramas. Hlad&iacute;k
has very skilfully represented the life and scenery of
Prague in a somewhat impressionist manner. His
countrymen have sometimes accused him of imitating
too closely the modern "decadent" French novelists.
To me his novels have often recalled the works of Mr.
George Moore. Of Mr. Hlad&iacute;k's novels the best is,
I think, the recently published <i>Ev&#382;en Voldan</i>, and of
his plays I admire most <i>Zavrat</i> ("Vertigo"), in which
the ancient subject of conjugal infidelity is treated in
a brilliant and original manner. Francis Herites (born
1851) is a fruitful writer of novels and short sketches,
and has contributed largely to many Bohemian reviews.
Of his many works I will mention one of the older
ones, entitled <i>Z m&eacute;ho herb&aacute;&#345;e</i>. It contains a short tale,
<i>Kokotice</i>; which is one of the most touching expressions
of Bohemian national feeling that I have ever read.</p>

<p>I will now refer to a group of writers whose fame&mdash;though
many of them have also written in prose&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
mainly founded on their poetry. The critics of the
future will probably consider as the greatest Bohemian
poet of the day Jaroslav Vrchlick&yacute;, though some now
prefer Svatopluk &#268;ech to him. Jaroslav Vrchlick&yacute;&mdash;the
pseudonym of Mr. Emil Frida&mdash;was born at Loun
in Bohemia in 1853. He began writing at an early
age, and has continued doing so uninterruptedly up
to the present day. Like Victor Hugo, to whom he
has been compared, and who certainly has greatly
influenced him, Vrchlick&yacute; has produced an enormous
number of works. His writings, which include lyric
and epic poems, dramas, numerous translations, and
a few works in prose, had in 1903 already reached a
total of 185 volumes. The principal characteristic of
Vrchlick&yacute;'s poetry is his mastership of the Bohemian
language, which he can almost be said to have raised
to a higher level. As the late Dr. Albert wrote, "He
works on his language as Paganini or Ond&#345;i&#269;ek on
their violins." This is particularly obvious in Vrchlick&yacute;'s
numerous translations from the works of English,
German, French, Italian, and Spanish writers. To
mention but one example, his rendering of Browning's
<i>Toccata of Galuppi</i> is masterly. I wish, however, to
devote to Vrchlick&yacute;'s original work the short space
that remains to me. The poet visited Italy early in
life, and soon acquired a thorough knowledge of the
language of that country. He also studied the literatures
of France and Spain. A new current of thought
was a result of these studies introduced into the
Bohemian language, for the writers of an earlier
period, brought up in the Bohemian schools, which
were then almost entirely German, had been with
scarcely an exception under the influence of German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
literature. Of Vrchlick&yacute;'s early works I will mention
<i>Z Hlubin</i> ("From the Depths"), which appeared in
1875, <i>Rok na jihu</i> ("A Year in the South"), which
contains reminiscences of the poet's Italian travels, and
<i>Bodlaci z Parnasu</i> ("Thorns from Parnassus "), in which
is included that truly beautiful poem, <i>Krumlovsk&aacute; Legenda</i>.
Vrchlick&yacute; is a master of the difficult art of the sonnet,
and his <i>Sonety samotare</i> (<i>i.e.</i> of a recluse) and <i>Nov&eacute;</i>
<i>sonety samotare</i> are among his finest works. One of
the poet's latest books, entitled <i>Episody</i>, contains some
beautiful poems referring to the period of the Hussite
wars. That period, as is natural, has inspired the
greatest works of many of the greatest Bohemian
writers. Vrchlick&yacute; has also obtained fame as a
dramatist His <i>Noc na Karl&#353;tejne</i> ("A Night at the
Karl&#353;tejn"), the scene of which is laid in the time
of Charles IV., has deservedly had great success, and
figures frequently in the repertoire of the National
Theatre of Prague. Vrchlick&yacute;'s <i>Julian Apostata</i> deals
with its difficult though fascinating subject in a very
striking manner. This brilliant play well bears comparison
with Ibsen's book on the same subject, and
Mere&#382;kovsky's <i>Death of the Gods</i>. Of Vrchlick&yacute;'s
many other works his Trilogy on the Greek tale of
Hippodamia deserves mention. It is quite impossible
to give in a few words even a fairly sufficient appreciation
of the work of Vrchlick&yacute;.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Some of the finest writings
of the poet have recently been translated into German.</p>

<p>Svatopluk &#268;ech, born in 1846 at Ost&#345;edek in Bohemia,
ranks with Vrchlick&yacute; as one of the greatest of modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>Bohemian poets. I consider it useless to enter into
the invidious and foolish question, to which of the
two great poets the primacy should be awarded.
Svatopluk &#268;ech is truly great as a writer of epic
poems, and here he may be considered as unrivalled
by modern writers, even in larger and better known
countries than his own. His first epic poem, <i>Adamite</i>,
deals with a strange, well-known episode in Bohemian
history. The <i>Smith of Le&#353;etin</i> (Le&#353;etinsk&yacute; Kov&aacute;&#345;),
portrays in an admirable manner the life of the
Bohemian peasantry. But the masterpiece of &#268;ech
is, I think, the epic poem entitled <i>V&aacute;clav z Michalovic</i>.
The hero of the poem is a young Bohemian, a son
of one of the nobles who were decapitated in Prague
after the disaster of the White Mountain. Some parts
of this poem, such as the prologue and the speech to
the people of Prague, which Michalovic delivers in the
Salvator Church, are of unrivalled beauty. Criticism
can obviously be founded only on individual impressions;
and I do not hesitate to state that no work
of modern Bohemian literature has impressed me as
strongly as <i>V&aacute;clav z Michalovic</i>. Of &#268;ech's other
poetical works, his sad, pessimistic, and&mdash;alas&mdash;truthful
<i>P&iacute;sn&#283; Otroka</i> ("Songs of a Slave") should be mentioned.
Svatopluk &#268;ech has also published a considerable number
of prose works. His <i>Povidky, Arabesky a Humoresky</i>,
in four volumes, have had a great success.</p>

<p>Of minor poets I will first mention Adolph Heyduk,
born in 1835 at Richenburg in Bohemia. Of his many
poetical works, <i>Cymbal a husle</i>, a tale of the life of the
Slavic inhabitants of Northern Hungary, has the greatest
value. Heyduk's <i>Dr&#283;vorubec</i> ("The Wood-cutter"), in
which, as in many others of the poet's works, the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
is laid in the Sumava (the so-called Bohemian woods),
has also obtained great success. J. V. Sl&aacute;dek (born
1845), formerly editor of the <i>Lumir</i> review, has translated
several works of Shakespeare and Byron, as well
as some of the Polish writings of Mickiewicz, into
Bohemian. A talented younger writer is J. S. Machar
(born 1864). His <i>Tristium Vindobona</i> is a very powerful
work, which brilliantly describes the depression while
dwelling in Vienna, and the antipathy to that city, which
appear almost innate in a Bohemian. Recently a friend
of Machar, V. A. Jung, has published an admirable Bohemian
translation of part of Byron's <i>Don Juan</i>. It is
to be hoped that the writer will complete his task. Mrs.
Kose (whose pseudonym is Tereza Dubrovsk&aacute;) has recently
published a clever volume of poems entitled
<i>P&iacute;sn&#283;</i> (poems). Miss Hurych, who writes under the name
Marie Kalma, has produced several novels that have had
considerable success. Mr. George Karasek ze Lvovic
has recently published several works both in prose and
in verse. Of these, his drama entitled <i>Apollonius z Tyany</i>
is perhaps the best.</p>

<h2><a name="BIBLIOGRAPHY" id="BIBLIOGRAPHY">BIBLIOGRAPHY</a></h2>


<p>Not unnecessarily to extend this list, I have enumerated only a few
books, dealing either with Bohemian literature as a whole, or with
considerable portions of it. Bohemian books have increased rapidly
within the last few years. I have therefore left unmentioned many
valuable monographs, which are indispensable to those who wish to
acquire a more thorough knowledge of Bohemian literature than I
have been able to give in this book. Literature and history are very
closely connected in Bohemia, and many of the modern historians,
such as Palack&yacute;, Gindely, Goll, Tieftrunk, Kalousek, and Flaj&#353;hans,
throw a great deal of light also on the literature of Bohemia. Much
valuable information on Bohemian literature is also contained in the
numerous editions of ancient Bohemian writings&mdash;frequently mentioned
in these pages&mdash;which appeared in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. Most of them contain valuable commentaries and
biographies. Besides the Journal of the Bohemian Museum, the
yearly publications of the Bohemian Society of Sciences and of the
Bohemian Academy incidentally devote their attention to the literature
of the country. Periodicals such as the <i>&#268;esky &#268;asopis historick&yacute;</i>,
<i>Lumir</i>, <i>Sv&#283;tozor</i>, <i>Osv&#283;ta</i>, and others contain many interesting articles
on Bohemian literature.</p>

<h2><a name="Literatures_of_the_World" id="Literatures_of_the_World">Literatures of the World</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">A SERIES OF SHORT HISTORIES
BY EMINENT WRITERS</p>

<p class="center">EDITED BY</p>
<p class="ph3">EDMUND GOSSE</p>

<p class="center">Each Volume Large Crown 8vo, price 6s.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gosse's introduction to this new series, the list of his collaborators,
his own wide knowledge and delicate taste, all assure us
that whatever high hopes he may raise, we need have no fear of their
ample fulfilment."&mdash;<i>The Saturday Review.</i></p>


<h3>A History of Japanese Literature.</h3>

<p class="blockquot">By <span class="smcap">William George Aston, C.M.G., D. Lit.</span>, late Japanese
Secretary to H. M. Legation, Tokio.</p>

<p>"Mr. Aston has made a very valuable and acceptable contribution to the
series. He approaches his difficult task in a sober but not unsympathetic
spirit, and he has unquestionably enabled the European reader for the first
time to enjoy a comprehensive survey of the vast and ancient field of Japanese
literature, of which we have had hitherto only furtive and partial glimpses. He
has clothed the dry bones of his subject with the flesh and blood of living
reality, and we can follow with unflagging interest the whole process of evolution
down to the most recent developments of the Japanese mind."&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>"Justice has been done for the first time to the neglected, or rather never
comprehended, subject of the prose and verse of Japan. This is what Mr.
Aston has effected, in a volume of unique erudition, wide research, clear discrimination,
and excellent design; while, by such an achievement, he has
wrought a memorable service not only to those interested in Japan and Japanese
studies, but to the world of letters at large, in the midst of which he now gives
to her literature an intelligible, established, and a very honourable place. The
literature of Japan will assuredly owe to Mr. Aston its first formal and adequate
introduction to the good opinion and respectful attention of the West."&mdash;Sir
<span class="smcap">Edwin Arnold</span> in <i>Literature</i>.</p>


<h3>A History of Spanish Literature.</h3>

<p class="blockquot">By <span class="smcap">J. Fitzmaurice-Kelly</span>, Corresponding Member of the
Spanish Academy.</p>

<p>"This is an excellent handbook. It is comprehensive, clear, concise; the
judgments are judicial, impartial; the style is good, lucid, and interesting.
It is work well done by one who has a thorough grip of his subject."&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span><i>The</i>
<i>Academy.</i></p>


<h3>A History of Italian Literature.</h3>

<p class="blockquot">By <span class="smcap">Richard Garnett</span>, C. B., LL. D., Keeper of Printed
Books in the British Museum.</p>

<p>"Dr. Garnett is lucid in arrangement, agreeable and correct. He has done
a real service to both English and Italian literatures."&mdash;<i>Literature.</i></p>


<h3>A History of Modern English
Literature.</h3>

<p class="blockquot">By <span class="smcap">Edmund Gosse</span>, Hon. M. A. Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>

<p>"We know of no volume better fitted to give a general conception of our
literature than this."&mdash;<i>The Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"A really useful account of the whole process of evolution in English
letters.... Full of insight and serenity of judgment."&mdash;<i>The Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>


<h3>A History of French Literature.</h3>

<p class="blockquot">By <span class="smcap">Edward Dowden</span>, D. C. L., LL. D., Professor of English
Literature in the University of Dublin.</p>

<p>"Certainly the best history of French literature in the English language."&mdash;<i>The</i>
<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>"This is a history of literature as histories of literature should be written.
The more closely one looks into this book, the more clearly is it seen how
much thought, how much mental selection, as well as how much reading, have
gone to the making of these picturesque portraits of writers."&mdash;<i>The Saturday</i>
<i>Review.</i></p>


<h3>A History of Ancient Greek Literature.</h3>

<p class="blockquot">By <span class="smcap">Gilbert Murray</span>, M. A., Professor of Greek in the
University of Glasgow.</p>

<p>"A sketch to which the much-abused word 'brilliant' may be justly
applied."&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>"The book is brilliant and stimulating, while its freshness of treatment and
recognition of the latest German research amply justify its existence. Professor
Murray has made these old Greek bones live."&mdash;<i>The Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
